   \caption{Simulation of voltage-clamp steps. $A$: Model was clamped at resting potential (-68\,mV) and then stepped to -100 or +40 mV. Superimposed top traces: membrane potential in the soma (s), main dendrite (m), and a distal spiny dendrite (d, marked with asterisk in \href{../pub-purkinje-deschutter1-fig-1/pub-purkinje-deschutter1-fig-1.tex}{\bf Fig.\,1}). Bottom trace: clamp current. $B$: as in $A$, but stepped to -40\,mV. $C$: membrane potential under steady-state voltage clamp vs. distance from the soma. Data from the same voltage-clamp steps as shown in $A$ and $B$. Data points are exclusively from compartments linking the soma with the distal spiny dendrite. Because the potential oscillated during steps to -40\,mV, 2 traces are shown for that voltage step (corresponding to the minimum and maximum voltage in the spiny dendrite). Simulation time step was 5\,$\mu$s.}
