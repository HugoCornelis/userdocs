- Dave did not apply patches yet.

- CNS tutorials.

- Dave skeptical about one day Neuron tutorials.
  - cannot teach anything significant about a simulator
  - so best to do is
    - overview
    - pep talk
    - sufficient resources for people to start using genesis
    - installation
    - ok to talk about G-3 and the 'Genesis family tree'
      - answers: what is genesis?

- last year's tutorials were about advanced topics.
  - people need prior experience

- tutorial audience target: new to genesis.

- new G-2 models, network models.

- at lascon
  - huge interest in plasticity in IaF neuron models


- long tutorial
  - introduction
  - single cell modeling
  - network modeling
  - STDP network modeling

- or: sales pitch for genesis
  - updated UGTD package
  - run simple simulations
  - hack them a bit
  - but even that is difficult for a single day tutorial

- tutorial lectures
  - try to get all to have the UGTD on their laptops
  - talk about some of the links
  - talk about some of the exercises

- DB plan:
  - UGTD updated with G-2.4
  - as a final G-2

- NEST becoming popular
  - 6 / 10 at lascon

- tell these poeple about G-2.4 and its STDP capability
  - will not be as fast
  - but does HH and morphology
  - as an advertisement

- abstract with a link to UGTD
  - some people may do this
  - having the abstract with a link to UGTD materials is good
    - because people have to pay for the tutorials

- lascon
  - internet access is a problem
  - flashdrives with zip files of G-2.4 developer release
  - G-source, compiled binaries is about 60MB

- one page handout
  - major links
  - cheat sheet
  - UGTD
  - getting the UGTD

- what do they need to learn
  - where to find it

- put together draft of tutorial abstract
  - what? is important
  - not long
  - most people won't go to the tutorial

- half day
  - new things
  - past no hsolve for networks
    - now it is there, huge performance improvements
    - introducction to hsolver to vastly speedups for large network simulations

  - STDP
    - new network models

  - we will give you the tools to teach yourself

  - by then UGTD link up-to-date

  - promise: CNS new release of UGTD
    - we are going to give a self-paced course about Genesis.
    - fast network modeling with STDP
    - has chemesis 2
    - many networks with STDP involve IaF models, this gives you the opportunity to apply these models to realistic models with conduction delays and neuron models with a dendritic morphology
    - what is going on in parallel with G-2: Moose, G-3

    - neuron does not do network modeling very well, hassle
      - does not do axonal delay very well
      - traub thalamo cortical model: neurons have no location
        - synaptic plasticity model is a not properly implemented

- tell Jim about these plans
  - in about a month from now
  - ask about his plans
