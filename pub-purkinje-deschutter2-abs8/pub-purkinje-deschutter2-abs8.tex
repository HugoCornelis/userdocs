\section*{De Schutter: Purkinje Cell Model}

\subsection*{Abstract}

This simulation work demonstrates that a model based on
voltage-clamp data and tuned entirely on the response of Purkinje
cells to current injection is capable of reproducing a wide range of
synaptically activated responses. In the presence of continuous
granule cell excitation the model showed a stable in vivo state
different from the silent, resting in vitro state. Further, the model
suggests that there may be important functional interactions between
different types of synaptic inputs. In particular, it makes
several specific predictions about the role of stellate cell inhibition.
