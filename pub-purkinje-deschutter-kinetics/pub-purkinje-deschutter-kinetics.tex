\subsubsection*{Estimating channel conductances}

Constructing an accurate
representation of an ionic channel also requires an estimate of
the channel $\bar g$. However, channel conductance values measured in
voltage-clamp experiments are often quite variable\,\cite{McCormick:1992fk} and are only indicative. For this reason,
channel $\bar g$s in the model were not based on experimental measurements\,\cite{S:1993dz, De-Schutter-E:1993fu}.

\subsubsection*{Estimating channel densities}

Having established and parameterized the equations governing the
voltage-dependent behavior of the ionic conductances in this
cell, it was necessary to determine the channel densities in the
model. Because precise information on channel densities is not
technically obtainable, channel densities, usually expressed as $\bar g$,
are largely a free parameter in detailed single-cell models\,\cite{S:1993dz, L:1992kl, W:1991qa, Traub-R-D:1991mi}.

In the present model, simulations were started using initial
guesses for the $\bar g$ of the different channels in four zones of the cell,
i.e. the soma, the main dendrite, the smooth dendrites, and the
spiny dendrites (see Fig. 1). $\bar g$s were then altered until the model
could reproduce the characteristic firing behavior of Purkinje cells
during current injection in vitro\,\cite{R:1980ly, R:1980pi},
as described in Figs. 3--7. During this optimization
process it was not necessary to distinguish between
the smooth and spiny dendrites. In addition, optimal performance
required that the Kdr and A currents be present in the
main dendrite as well as in the soma.

Also, several combinations of $\bar g$ were found that could account for
the responses of Purkinje cells to current injection. For contrast,
versions PM9 and PM10 are presented, where PM10 represents
a Purkinje cell with higher K$^+$ channel densities, i.e., a leakier
cell.

\subsubsection*{Temperature dependence of channel kinetics}

Temperature is a well-known critical parameter for channel kinetics\,\cite{B:1991zr}.
In the current simulations the in vivo and in vitro data
used to tune the model were collected at 37\,$^\circ$\,C whereas all of the
published voltage-clamp data were obtained at room temperature.
Assuming a Q\,10 factor of 3\,\cite{L:1952fv} all rate constants were multiplied by a factor of 5.

\subsubsection*{Modeling calcium concentrations}

In the present model realistic simulation of Ca$^{2+}$ concentrations was not attempted. However, computation of Ca$^{2+}$ concentrations was required to activate the
KC and K2 channels. Because these channels are assumed to be
sensitive to the quickly changing, high Ca$^{2+}$ concentrations just
below the membrane surface\,\cite{L:1989ff}, Ca$^{2+}$ concentrations were 
computed in a thin submembrane shell\,\cite{D:1982lh}. These shells integrated the full Ca$^{2+}$ inflow through
the CaP and CaT channels. Their volume and decay time constants
were initially free parameters in the model. The model tuning
resulted in shells 0.2\,$\mu$m deep with a decay time of 0.1\,ms.
The basal internal Ca$^{2+}$ concentration was 0.040\,$\mu$M; the outside
concentration was constant at 2.4\,mM. These concentrations
were also used to compute Nernst potentials\,\cite{B:1991zr} for the
CaP and CaT currents.
