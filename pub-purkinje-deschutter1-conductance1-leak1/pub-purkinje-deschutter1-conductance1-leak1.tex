\subsection*{Leak Current}

In addition to the voltage-dependent currents just described,
it was also necessary to include a leak current. The
leak conductance was determined by $R_m$, and the reversal potentialwas -80\,mV. This resulted in a small hyperpolarizing current atrest, which compensated for subthreshold inward currents(mainly NaP and CaT currents), so that a stable resting potentialof -68\,mV was achieved.
