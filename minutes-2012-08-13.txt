- situation: this week Hugo more available than next week.
- functions
  - fundamental:
    - createmap
      - python: yes
        - run time casting needed for creating the network object.
      - gshell: yes
    - createprojection
      - python: no
        - run time casting needed for creating the network object.
      - gshell: yes
  - periphery:
    - output resolution time step: output_time_step <seconds>
      - python: no
      - gshell: yes
    - remove output time stamp
      - python: yes
      - gshell: yes
    - current injection pulse
      - python: yes, using pulsegen object
      - gshell: no
- validation
  - steady current injection is good enough for testing and validation
  - discrepancies
    - G-2 changes default refractory period of spikegen?
    - small refractory period in G-2 scripts.
    - needs additional check.
  - Dave Beeman sends G-2 of 4x4 script to Hugo.
- NDF scripting vs editing.
  - morphology editing, channel addition / modification.
    - single cell modeling only.
    - additional editing of NDF files needed.
  - chemesis / network modeling different
    - simple script leads to complicated pathways / networks
  - NDF scripting for networks would be useful for the workshop
    - Hugo will do analysis of the complexity.
  - what are changes between rscell_nolib.ndf and rscell_nolib2.ndf
    - likely related to ndf_save not working properly
    - will be discussed during workshop between Dave and Hugo
- Feedback about tutorials to respond to.
- optimization can lead to problems with compilation of script bindings
- gshell
  - variations for the creation of projection
    - createprojection: many connections
    - creation of individual connections
      - need for pythonesque syntax: createconnection
      - sometimes read from ascii file
        - capability already present in the model-container
        - see tests/specifications/projectionquery.t test specification of the model-container.
- next call
  - coming Friday 11am SA time.
    - depending on progress, status at that time.
