- not enough staffing
- no possibility to increase this because of limited funding
- Mando still on 10% -- via unofficial commitments between two labs.
- Jim's priorities
  - pay more to Hugo -- after 4 months
  - next 4 months:
    - looking for more funding
    - Simon, waiting for NDF save
    - support those people who were at the workshop.
    - PC comparison project, Volker has a computer science student
    -
- Dave will interact with Simon to keep Simon going.
- Simon in interaction with Mike Vanier, implementing network model.
  - Also in interaction with people in Luebeck about a grant proposal.
- Papers and other writings.
  - Encyclopedia article (Padraig), Jim will write it and ask for feedback.
  - Grant writing
    - About collaboration functionality -- lineage system, tutorial generator.
      - February deadline / NSF?
      - Resubmit multi-scale modeling grant to NIH.
  - Publications
    - Needed for grant approvals.
    - Scientific publications.
      - PC comparison -- not soon.
      - Auditory cortex -- in G-2 -- with scientific figure -- for modelDB -- as basis for tutorial -- via CNS?
  - Commercial tracks / possibilities.
    - Jim says: HSC situation not stable.
      - Medical school dean does not support research.
      - Cuts salary of faculty
    - No director will be hired at barshop.
    - Augusto left / Rachael? left.
    - Nothing goes back to Texas.
    - Applying for other positions, including one in Boulder / Santa Cruse.
    - Market / Marketing plan
      - By other publishers being involved: Springer / Kluwer, letter of support.
      - Promega, biotech firm, use of modelling to develop understanding.
    - First develop molecular level piece -- pharma industry.
- Neuron does not have
- G-2 has powerful algorithms to specify weights / delays of connections.
  - volumeweight: exp decay of weights
  - Dave implements volumeconnect with gaussian probability connectivity in G-2
  - function must be copied to G-3
  - MV piriform cortex network model.
    - making precise network models / sophisticated network models
- G-3 workshop in Freiburg.
  - must do better than Luebeck.
  - multiscale modeling is needed.
  - people in Freiburg interested Neuron / NEST
  - Jim not attending CNS in Paris?
  - But there is not going to be a user release at that time.

- when you go to other universities
  - writing books
  - putting together collaborations -- coordinators
    - working on G-3 infrastructure


- List of priorities
  - ndf_save -- Hugo
    - three interfaces
      - one file, one model
      - several files in a library
      - one model in several files.
  - python bindings for network functionality -- Mando
  - scientific work / auditory cortex network -- Dave
    - need for separate volumeweight.
