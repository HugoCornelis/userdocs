- HH workshop (Jim)
  - model are key components of collaboration.
    - ref. to recent Higgs boson discovery.
  - numerical underpinnings of different neural simulators.
    - Neuron is least efficient.
    - Based on flaws?
    - maybe comes to workshop Luebeck.
  - siman comes to meeting.
- CNS
  - daphne and christoph both coming.
    - must talk to them to organize the Luebeck in workshop.
  - poster
    - not multiscale focussed
    - timeline
      - construction of G-3
      - milestones
        - model-container / heccer
        - developer package
        - python / gshell scriptings.
        - GUI screenshots.
      - we have been working on this for a long time.
    - aiming for multiscale modeling.
      - different levels -- network / chemesis.
    - central panel.
    - Mando meets Jim tomorrow at 9am.
    - Everyone sends material to Mando by tonight.
- CNS workshop
  - Jim does introduction.
  - Cerebellar project -- scientific aspects.
  - Likely small workshop -- more interactive workshop?
- RSnet conversation
  - model conversation.
    - connection types.
    - volume connect and manually inserted connections.
  - syntax and semantics discussion.
  - scripts structured in compliance with the user workflow.
  - will continue over email.
- general progress, things on the list

    - business models and alike, should discuss soon.
  - installation status
    - CPAN / SWIG / RPMs / DEBs.
    - catch all solution: access to CBI machines.
  - chemesis representational problems
    - model-container.
    - connections must be scriptable.
  - single cell modeling
    - replace one channel with another one in an pre-existing single cell model.
