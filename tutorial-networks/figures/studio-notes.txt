Notes on using the Neurospaces Studio
-------------------------------------

*Provided by Hugo Cornelis*


At the gsejj 'genesis prompt', type 'explore' to start the neurospaces
studio.  The most useful menus that will appear are::

1. The Information Extractor button: After clicking the 'Render'
button without adjusting the settings, this button renders a
conceptual diagram of the network showing the populations and
projections.  This needs dependencies of GraphViz, perl-GraphViz and
gv.

2. The Explorer button: allows one to browse the model in its usual way.
In each opened window, the left most panel shows model components that
can be explored by double clicking them.  If SDL is installed, the
scene can be rendered in 3D (although the 3D currently does not
integrate well with the gshell).

3. The Connection Matrix button: allows to inspect the connection
matrix.	 First select one or more projections in the list of four
(multi-selection by holding down the shift key).   The window with
spiking related elements holds all spike generating elements in the
selected projections on the left, and the spike receiving elements on
the right.  Select a spike generating element, and the window with the
result set will show the attached elements (it does not show important
parameters such as weight and delay).

4. The other buttons are different ways to explore the ndf files and
the algorithms that have been loaded by the script.

5. Use the 'Quit' menu button to close all the windows and
return control to the command line shell.
