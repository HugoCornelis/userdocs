\section*{De Schutter: Purkinje Cell Model}

\subsection*{Abstract}

Inhibitory synapses of the sort presumably generated by stellate
cells were also added to the dendritic tree. When asynchronous
activation of these inhibitory synapses was combined with
continuous asynchronous excitatory input the model generated
somatic action potentials in a much more stochastic pattern typical
of real Purkinje cells. Under these conditions simulated interspike
interval distributions resembled those found in experimental
recordings. Also, as with in vivo recordings, the model did not
generate dendritic bursts. This was mainly due to inhibition that
suppressed the generation of dendritic Ca$^{2+}$ spikes.
