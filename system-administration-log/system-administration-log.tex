\section*{System Administration Log}

This is a document listing all of all administration done on machines
used in the GENESIS project.

Please only add records.  Do not delete or modify existing records.

In the past the file system of some of the machines supporting for G-3
development had become corrupted because of all the manual
maintenance.  Therefore we keep track of the manual maintenance, and
try to automate as much as possible over the
\href{../version-control/version-control.tex}{source code
  repositories} and
\href{../neurospaces-cron/neurospaces-cron.tex}{cron jobs}.

\subsection*{repo-genesis3.cbi.utsa.edu}

The repository machine serves the source code for the GENESIS project as well as periodically performing automated source code checks. This machine also has a running web server that hosts the projects: doxygen documentation, regression tests, and various package distributions.


\begin{itemize}

\item
\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Mando
\item[] {\bf Date:} 1/18/2011 
\item[] {\bf Actions:} Restarted the monotone server with the sspy repository set.
\item[] {\bf Reason:} To allow code syncing for sspy when it's ready.
\item[] {\bf Impact:}  Developer scripts should be able to connect to the sspy repository if the option is set.
\end{itemize}

\item
\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Mando
\item[] {\bf Date:} 1/18/2011 
\item[] {\bf Actions:} Checked repository access to the gtube mercurial repository.
\item[] {\bf Reason:} The mercurial repository is refusing to allow a check in after dropping a file. Getting this exception:

\begin{verbatim}
bort: empty or missing revlog for genesis3/.DS_Store
remote: ** unknown exception encountered, details follow
remote: ** report bug details to http://mercurial.selenic.com/bts/
remote: ** or mercurial@selenic.com
remote: ** Python 2.5.2 (r252:60911, Jan 24 2010, 17:44:40) [GCC 4.3.2]
remote: ** Mercurial Distributed SCM (version 1.6.2)
remote: ** Extensions loaded: 

\end{verbatim} 

The .DS\_Store file is a file automatically created by Mac OS X used to index directories.  

\item[] {\bf Impact:} Currently won't allow any of my recent check ins to be pushed to the server. 
\end{itemize}

\item
\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Hugo
\item[] {\bf Date:} 1/12/2011 
\item[] {\bf Actions:} Made two trace files available for download to monotone developer, strace.out and ltrace.out.
\item[] {\bf Reason:} Reporting monotone bugs to monotone developers.
\item[] {\bf Impact:} More files available in the public download area.
\end{itemize}

\item
\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Mando
\item[] {\bf Date:} 1/12/2011 
\item[] {\bf Actions:} Turned on the DISTCLEAN option in neurospaces\_cron.
\item[] {\bf Reason:} Some machines do not rebuild config.status and attempt to use the old version of the file to create Makefiles. If it attempts to rebuild a Makefile that has since been removed from the workspace it will kill the cronjob. The distclean option deletes config.status and forces it to be rebuilt on every cron run. 
\item[] {\bf Impact:} Should prevent the cronjob from breaking should a Makefile be deleted from, or moved within a package workspace.
\end{itemize}

\item
\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Mando
\item[] {\bf Date:} 1/10/2011 
\item[] {\bf Actions:} Added a blank sspy repository.
\item[] {\bf Reason:} Development on the python scheduler is proceeding so a repository will be needed. When the repository is ready will be a simple matter to turn it on and sync. 
\item[] {\bf Impact:} None
\end{itemize}

\item
\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Mando
\item[] {\bf Date:} 1/7/2011 
\item[] {\bf Actions:} Removed the neurospaces\_project directory and did a fresh pull.
\item[] {\bf Reason:} Due to several file moves done during the python swig bindings the tester could not properly update the workspace, this kills the cron job. Changes from the build machine do not seem to propagate properly to the tester. Also permissions on test scripts were not updating with new cron runs.
\item[] {\bf Impact:} Tester should proceed as normal.
\end{itemize}


\item
\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Mando
\item[] {\bf Date:} 1/5/2010 
\item[] {\bf Actions:} Checked the tester to see if it installs the built
SWIG python libraries correctly.
\item[] {\bf Reason:} Simple import test for installed modules seems to be failing. Tester seems to be installing the module correctly, but the test currently fails.
\item[] {\bf Impact:} No change.
\end{itemize}

\item
\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Hugo
\item[] {\bf Date:} 26/12/2010 
\item[] {\bf Actions:} Continued the work of the previous item after
  help with a work around from the monotone mailing list.  Both
  neurospaces\_pull and neurospaces\_update were succesful.
\item[] {\bf Reason:} Adding rtxi to repo-genesis3.cbi.utsa.edu
\item[] {\bf Impact:} Correctly initialized repository and workspace
  for the rtxi component on repo-genesis3.cbi.utsa.edu.
\end{itemize}


\item
\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Hugo
\item[] {\bf Date:} 25/12/2010 
\item[] {\bf Actions:} Trying to initialize the rtxi repository and
  pull its content from my laptop in belgium.  Directories created,
  repository initialized.  Pull was stopped by a presumed bug in
  monotone, reported on the monotone list.  Will try again after
  feedback from the list.
\item[] {\bf Reason:} Adding rtxi to repo-genesis3.cbi.utsa.edu
\item[] {\bf Impact:} None
\end{itemize}


\item
\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Hugo
\item[] {\bf Date:} 12/12/2010 
\item[] {\bf Actions:} Removed untarred contents of cpan module installation directories.
\begin{verbatim}
sudo rm -fr Clone-0.31/ Data-Utilities-0.04/ Digest-SHA-5.48/ File-Find-Rule-0.32/ HTML-Table-2.08a/ HTML-Template-2.9/ Inline-0.46/ Number-Compare-0.01/ Test-Simple-0.96/ Text-Glob-0.08/
\end{verbatim}
\item[] {\bf Reason:} The tester was still complaining about the permissions of:
\begin{verbatim}
	drwx------ 4 root     root       4096 2010-12-11 12:34 HTML-Table-2.08a
\end{verbatim}

\item[] {\bf Impact:} Directories removed, hopefully the additional
  code added to the developer package to remove cpan source code
  directories after their installation keeps the tester in a sane
  state from now on.
\end{itemize}


\item
\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Mando
\item[] {\bf Date:} 12/11/2010 
\item[] {\bf Actions:} Checked status on cpan directory and its unzipped contents.
\item[] {\bf Reason:} The unzipped directories are getting unzipped as root as opposed to random uid/gids as before:

\item
\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Mando
\item[] {\bf Date:} 12/10/2010 
\item[] {\bf Actions:} Deleted some directories in the developer package generated from unzipping cpan tarballs.
\item[] {\bf Reason:} The unzipped directories were getting corrupted user and group permissions as noted:

Permissions seem to be set randomly, not sure of the exact cause.
\item[] {\bf Impact:} Tester should proceed as normal.
\end{itemize}



\item
\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Mando
\item[] {\bf Date:} 12/10/2010 
\item[] {\bf Actions:} Checked machine to diagnose problem with the build of debian and rpm packages.
\item[] {\bf Reason:} Without warning the build for rpm and debian packages has failed. No error report in the email.
\item[] {\bf Impact:} deb and rpm packages are currently offline.
\end{itemize}
	
\item
\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Mando
\item[] {\bf Date:} 12/01/2010 
\item[] {\bf Actions:} Added Dave's monotone identifier to the .monotone/write-permissions file of the monotone user running the mtn server.
\item[] {\bf Reason:} Identifier must be put into the write-permissions file to allow a user write access even if the key has been added to the database.
\item[] {\bf Impact:} Dave can sync to the documentation system.
\end{itemize}
	
\item
\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Mando
\item[] {\bf Date:} 11/22/2010 
\item[] {\bf Actions:} Added Dave's monotone key to the userdocs system.
\item[] {\bf Reason:} Dave needs his key added so that he can add documents.
\item[] {\bf Impact:} None.
\end{itemize}
	
\item
\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Hugo
\item[] {\bf Date:} 11/08/2010 
\item[] {\bf Actions:} Checking file timestamps, diffing expected and seen output.
\item[] {\bf Reason:} One test that started failing without any
  apparant reason.  The output test of the gshell seems not to respect
  the output clock anymore, unknown reason.
\item[] {\bf Impact:} None.
\end{itemize}	

\item
\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Mando
\item[] {\bf Date:} 10/28/2010 
\item[] {\bf Actions:} Fixed some issues with the userdocs installation on the repository. 
\item[] {\bf Reason:} Build was failing due to some permission errors. Errors with the gtube specification images still remain. Difficult to diagnose due to very vague error message. Forums don't provide much help.
\item[] {\bf Impact:} Cronjob for building userdocs on the repo should proceed as normal.
\end{itemize}	

\item
\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Mando
\item[] {\bf Date:} 10/22/2010 
\item[] {\bf Actions:} Attempted to fix the issues with images on the repository userdocs installation. 
\item[] {\bf Reason:} All gtube technical specification images are gone. Making a png of an eps fails with the non descriptive "Unrecoverable error, exit code 1" message. Also some other images have images cropped off on their sides for no apparent reason.
\item[] {\bf Impact:} None, tho the issue remains.
\end{itemize}	

\item
\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Mando
\item[] {\bf Date:} 10/21/2010 
\item[] {\bf Actions:} Set up the documentation system on a cron job on the repository. 
\item[] {\bf Reason:} Darwin mangles figures, linking the documentation from the repo is a short term fix.
\item[] {\bf Impact:} Debian latex should make it easier to fix the issue with the mangled figures.
\end{itemize}

\item
\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Mando
\item[] {\bf Date:} 10/10/2010 
\item[] {\bf Actions:} Uploaded some doxygen and epydoc documentation for the gtube source code. 
\item[] {\bf Reason:} Doesn't automatically update and there is no hook for epydoc yet. Want to see the look and functionality of both sets of documentation on the server.
\item[] {\bf Impact:} Two sets of "identical" documentation are now on the server, each with their own sets of features and appearances.
\end{itemize}
	
\item
\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Hugo
\item[] {\bf Date:} 9/26/2010 
\item[] {\bf Actions:} Added a line 'LOGDIR: /var/www/html/tests/neurospaces\_cron\_logs' to '/home/g3tester/neurospaces\_cron\_all.yml'.
\item[] {\bf Reason:} Sometimes the tester output of two consecutive
  cron jobs gets concatenated into one neurospaces\_cron.stdout file.
\item[] {\bf Impact:} No doubled output anymore for two consecutively executed cron jobs.
\end{itemize}

\item
\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Mando
\item[] {\bf Date:} 9/16/2010 
\item[] {\bf Actions:} Inspected permissions on directories served over the internet.
\item[] {\bf Reason:} Suspected some files or directories may be owned by root instead of g3tester. Was not the case, permissions were ok.
\item[] {\bf Impact:} None
\end{itemize}

\item 
\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Mando
\item[] {\bf Date:} 9/16/2010 
\item[] {\bf Actions:} Retrieve a copy of the neurospaces\_cron configuration file for testing.
\item[] {\bf Reason:} Going to retest the output of source tarballs and packages with the same configuration to check for any bugs.
\item[] {\bf Impact:} None
\end{itemize}
	
\item 
\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Hugo
\item[] {\bf Date:} 8/29/2010 
\item[] {\bf Actions:} Inspecting crontab and tester configuration
  files.
\item[] {\bf Reason:} Sometimes the tester output of two consecutive
  cron jobs gets concatenated into one neurospaces\_cron.stdout file.
  This seems to happen only when the configuration file
  ``/home/g3tester/neurospaces\_cron\_all.yml'' is used.  For those
  runs, errors are reported twice because they occur twice in the
  report that reports about two consecutive runs.
  The line
\begin{verbatim}
LOGDIR: /var/www/html/tests/neurospaces_cron_logs
\end{verbatim}
  is missing from ``/home/g3tester/neurospaces\_cron\_all.yml'', such
  that neurospaces\_cron does not rotate logs in the correct directory
  (I guess it attempts it either in the /tmp or /root directory).
  Inside neurospaces\_cron the function rotate\_logs() is likely also
  responsible for partial truncation of the output file.
\item[] {\bf Impact:} None
\end{itemize}

\item 
\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Mando
\item[] {\bf Date:} 8/22/2010 
\item[] {\bf Actions:} Removed source code directories building up during packaging.
\item[] {\bf Reason:} The unzipped directories were not being cleaned by the packaging process. Extra directories of code were appearing in the doxygen documentation.
\item[] {\bf Impact:} Doxygen documentation should no longer have multiple directories of the same code listed.
\end{itemize}

\item 
\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Hugo
\item[] {\bf Date:} 8/22/2010 
\item[] {\bf Actions:} None
\item[] {\bf Reason:} It takes a very long time to execute
  userdocs-sync and neurospaces\_sync.  Checking if ssh connection to
  repo-genesis3 and other servers takes as long (and it does).
\item[] {\bf Impact:} None.
\end{itemize}

\item 
\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Mando
\item[] {\bf Date:} 8/20/2010 
\item[] {\bf Actions:} Added monotone keys for my other machines: the 64 bit desktop, desktop and laptop Virtual machines.
\item[] {\bf Reason:} Could not sync to the experiment repository from my other machines.
\item[] {\bf Impact:} Public keys for three other machines are now on the experiment repository.

\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Mando
\item[] {\bf Date:} 8/13/2010

\begin{itemize}
	\item[] 1. Restarted the monotone repository servers.
	\item[] 2. Installed package building software.
\end{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Reason:} 
\begin{itemize}
	\item[] 1. At some point late 8/11 or early 8/12 the monotone repositories became unconnectable. Cause unknown for now but will continue to monitor the situation.
	\item[] 2. The noon cron run uses dpkg and rpmbuild to build packages, needed to install them. Updated neurospaces-cron document to reflect this.

\item[] {\bf Reason:} 
\begin{itemize}
\item[] Needed more packages installed for doxygen, source-highlight, tex, etc. 
\item[] Added and documented how to install a package to set the clock time.
\item[] Cronjob for Noon did not go off so testing crontab with a wall command:
\begin{verbatim}
	* * * * * root wall /etc/testmsg
\end{verbatim}
Where testmsg is a text file with a broadcast message.
\end{itemize}
	
\item[] {\bf Impact:} 
\begin{itemize}
\item[] Doxygen documentation should be updated with graphs and regression tests should be updated on cronrun. 
\item[] Time is properly set on the server.
\item[] cron daemon was verified to work correctly.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Hugo
\item[] {\bf Date:} 8/10/2010 
\item[] {\bf Actions:} Upgrade the monotone repository to version 0.48
  (mtn db migrate). Manual upgrade of the developer package
  (neurospaces\_pull, neurospaces\_update, neurospaces\_install on the
  developer package only).  Then as the monotone user:
  neurospaces\_create\_directories and neurospaces\_init --regex
  experiment.
\begin{verbatim}

as root: sudo -H -u monotone nohup neurospaces_serve &
on my laptop: neurospaces_sync
\end{verbatim}
\item[] {\bf Reason:} Developer package configuration was updated with
  the experiment software package.  The experiment monotone server
  must be created and started manually.
\item[] {\bf Impact:} All repositories (includes the experiment
  repository) should be up and running again.
\end{itemize}

\item 
\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Mando
\item[] {\bf Date:} 7/9/2010 
\item[] {\bf Actions:} Started monotone server, removed old 32-bit RPM files and directories to upload newer versions, and did an integrity check on the server.
\item[] {\bf Reason:} Server had a new hard drive installed and rebuilt the RAID so needed to start the monotone server that does not start on boot and make sure it was running properly.

\item[] {\bf Admin:} Mando
\item[] {\bf Date:} 7/2/2010 
\item[] {\bf Actions:} Removed simrc file in g3tester home directory after fixing the problem with finding the simrc in the executable directory.
\item[] {\bf Reason:} The .simrc-ns-sli file in the home directory was masking a bug in determining the simrc file in the executable directory. 
\item[] {\bf Impact:} Removing the file will allow the tests to continue with a file that is under monotone control.

\subsection*{darwin.cbi.utsa.edu}

This machine hosts the GENESIS website as well as the output from the user documentation system. All of the user documentation building tasks are done through a single non-root user account named \'genesis\'.

\begin{itemize}

\item 
\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Hugo
\item[] {\bf Date:} 9/21/2010 
\item[] {\bf Actions:} Comparing monotone version control identifiers, checking output of latex compilation.  The cbi-archtecture document is tagged as draft, so it is not compiled by the documentation system during a build.  This behavior is undesirable for some documents but is ok for others.  Maybe we need to introduce a new tag for this type of situation.  Added to the developer TODOs.
\item[] {\bf Reason:} The cbi-archtecture document fails to compile, but the errors are not reported by the documentation system.

\subsection*{Mac Tester}

The Mac tester is an iMac machine located at {\bf CBI} that runs the tester on a cronjob. It is also used for debugging and building packages for 32-bit Mac OSX Snow Leopard.

System specs:
\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Processor:} 2 Ghz Intel Core Duo
\item[] {\bf Memory:} 2 GB 667 Mhz DDR2 SDRAM
\item[] {\bf Operating System:} Mac OSX Snow Leopard (Version 10.6.4) 
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}

\item 
\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Mando
\item[] {\bf Date:} 1/14/2011
\item[] {\bf Actions:} 

\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf 1.} Created a copy of the workspace to examine the contents for potential bugs. 
\item[] {\bf 2.} Updated version of monotone from 0.47 to 0.99.1 to see if this alleviates some of the issues before posting to the monotone mailing list.
\end{itemize}

\item[] {\bf Reason:}  The mac tester is refusing to pull or update to any revisions past those checked in on 1/04/2011. This leaves it in a state where it cannot properly update the workspace and leaves some bugs that were since fixed:

|   
|   ChangeLog: 
|   
|   1. Added an exception for not resolving an address in the python Swig bindings.
\end{verbatim}

No other machine seems to have this issue. Attempted many fixes but the end result was always the heccer repository failing to pull down any revision past da53dc5ab63f91184f25068613e4d39eadc66c2e on 1/4/2011.  The only way to prevent the error from occurring again was to perform a repull the heccer repository and creating a new workspace. After doing a new pull, all revisions were present. The bug is reproducible with saved copies of the repository so old repositories in monotone version 0.47, migrated versions of the faulty repos in monotone 99.1 have been preserved.

\item[] {\bf Impact:}  Tester should proceed as normal.
\end{itemize}

\item 
\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Mando
\item[] {\bf Date:} 1/13/2011
\item[] {\bf Actions:} Got the mac tester back online.
\item[] {\bf Reason:}  It was previously switched off to be moved to a different desk.
\item[] {\bf Impact:}  Should proceed as normal.
\end{itemize}

\item 
\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Mando
\item[] {\bf Date:} 9/14/2010
\item[] {\bf Reason:} An error citing python as being not executable. 
\item[] {\bf Actions:} env now finds /usr/bin before the standard mac python location. Added the standard mac location to the crontab path as it cites only the regular unix locations.
\item[] {\bf Impact:} Test should not output an error any longer.
\end{itemize}
	
\item 
\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Mando

\item 
\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Mando

\item 
\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Mando
\item[] {\bf Date:} 7/12/2010
\item[] {\bf Reason:} Tester is "stuck" due to a bug in monotone that causes a merge conflict.
\item[] {\bf Actions:} Made a copy of the "stuck" monotone repositories and did a fresh pull. Since monotone version is 0.47, will check to see if this is a new bug or one that was previously fixed.
\item[] {\bf Impact:} Tester now proceeds as normal.

\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Mando
