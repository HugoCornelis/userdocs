\section*{System Administration Log}

This is a document listing all of all administration done on machines used in the GENESIS project.

\subsection*{repo-genesis3.cbi.utsa.edu}

The repository machine serves the source code for the GENESIS project as well as periodically performing automated source code checks. This machine also has a running web server that hosts the projects: doxygen documentation, regression tests, and various package distributions.


\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Mando
\item[] {\bf Date:} 7/9/2010 
\item[] {\bf Actions:} Started monotone server, removed old 32-bit RPM files and directories to upload newer versions, and did an integrity check on the server.
\item[] {\bf Reason:} Server had a new hard drive installed and rebuilt the RAID so needed to start the monotone server that does not start on boot and make sure it was running properly. 
\item[] {\bf Impact:} N/A

\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Mando
\item[] {\bf Date:} 7/6/2010
\item[] {\bf Actions:} Removed old Mac OSX NS-SLI package from the downloadable area.
\item[] {\bf Reason:}   Package has a known bug in determining the execution path. 
\item[] {\bf Impact:} Should not affect Repository or Tester operations.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Mando
\item[] {\bf Date:} 7/2/2010 
\item[] {\bf Actions:} Removed simrc file in g3tester home directory after fixing the problem with finding the simrc in the executable directory.
\item[] {\bf Reason:} The .simrc-ns-sli file in the home directory was masking a bug in determining the simrc file in the executable directory. 
\item[] {\bf Impact:} Removing the file will allow the tests to continue with a file that is under monotone control.
\end{itemize}





\subsection*{darwin.cbi.utsa.edu}

This machine hosts the GENESIS website as well as the output from the user documentation system. All of this is done through a single non-root user account named \'genesis\'.

\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Mando
\item[] {\bf Date:} 7/6/2010
