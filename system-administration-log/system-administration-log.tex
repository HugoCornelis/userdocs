\section*{System Administration Log}

This is a document listing all of all administration done on machines used in the GENESIS project.

\subsection*{repo-genesis3.cbi.utsa.edu}

The repository machine serves the source code for the GENESIS project as well as periodically performing automated source code checks. This machine also has a running web server that hosts the projects: doxygen documentation, regression tests, and various package distributions.

\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Mando
\item[] {\bf Date:} 7/2/2010 
\item[] {\bf Actions:} Removed simrc file in g3tester home directory after fixing the problem with finding the simrc in the executable directory.
\item[] {\bf Impact:} The .simrc-ns-sli file in the home directory was masking a bug in determining the simrc file in the executable directory. Removing the file has no negative impact on cron testing of source code. 
\end{itemize}


\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Mando
\item[] {\bf Date:} 7/6/2010
\item[] {\bf Actions:} Removed old Mac OSX NS-SLI package from the downloadable area since it has a known bug in determining the execution path. Replaced with an updated package.  
\item[] {\bf Impact:} Should not affect Repository or Tester operations.
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{darwin.cbi.utsa.edu}

This machine hosts the GENESIS website as well as the output from the user documentation system. All of this is done through a single non-root user account.

\begin{itemize}

\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Mac Tester}

The Mac tester is an iMac machine located at {\bf CBI} that runs the tester on a cronjob. It is also used for debugging and building packages for 32-bit Mac OSX Snow Leopard.

\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Mando
\item[] {\bf Date:} 7/6/2010
\item[] {\bf Actions:} Added Hugo to the Mac Tester email.
