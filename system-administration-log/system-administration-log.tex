\section*{System Administration Log}

This is a document listing all of all administration done on machines
used in the GENESIS project.

Please only add records.  Do not delete or modify existing records.


\subsection*{repo-genesis3.cbi.utsa.edu}

The repository machine serves the source code for the GENESIS project as well as periodically performing automated source code checks. This machine also has a running web server that hosts the projects: doxygen documentation, regression tests, and various package distributions.


\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Hugo
\item[] {\bf Date:} 8/12/2010 
\item[] {\bf Actions:} Attempt to install XML::Simple from CPAN.
Got Expat.xs:12:19: error: expat.h: No such file or directory, so also installed libexpat1-dev

\item[] {\bf Reason:} The exchange tests were failing.
\item[] {\bf Impact:} Installed libexpat1-dev and XML::Simple and its
  CPAN dependencies.  perl -e 'use XML::Simple' is successful.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Mando
\item[] {\bf Date:} 8/12/2010 
\item[] {\bf Actions:} 
\begin{itemize}
	\item[] 1. Restarted the monotone repository servers.
	\item[] 2. Installed package building software.
\end{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Reason:} 
\begin{itemize}
	\item[] 1. At some point late 8/11 or early 8/12 the monotone repositories became unconnectable. Cause unknown for now but will continue to monitor the situation.
	\item[] 2. The noon cron run uses dpkg and rpmbuild to build packages, needed to install them. Updated neurospaces-cron document to reflect this.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Mando
\item[] {\bf Date:} 8/11/2010 
\item[] {\bf Actions:} Continued installation of server software.
\item[] {\bf Reason:} 
\begin{itemize}
\item[] Needed more packages installed for doxygen, source-highlight, tex, etc. 
\item[] Added and documented how to install a package to set the clock time.
\item[] Cronjob for Noon did not go off so testing crontab with a wall command:
\begin{verbatim}
	* * * * * root wall /etc/testmsg
\end{verbatim}
Where testmsg is a text file with a broadcast message.
\end{itemize}
	
\item[] {\bf Impact:} 
\begin{itemize}
\item[] Doxygen documentation should be updated with graphs and regression tests should be updated on cronrun. 
\item[] Time is properly set on the server.
\item[] cron daemon was verified to work correctly.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Hugo
\item[] {\bf Date:} 8/10/2010 
\item[] {\bf Actions:} Upgrade the monotone repository to version 0.48
  (mtn db migrate). Manual upgrade of the developer package
  (neurospaces\_pull, neurospaces\_update, neurospaces\_install on the
  developer package only).  Then as the monotone user:
  neurospaces\_create\_directories and neurospaces\_init --regex
  experiment.
\begin{verbatim}
as monotone: cat monotone_keys/mando.pubkey monotone_keys/hugo.pubkey monotone_keys/allan.pubkey | mtn --db=~/neurospaces_project/MTN/experiment.mtn read
as root: sudo -H -u monotone nohup neurospaces_serve &
on my laptop: neurospaces_sync
\end{verbatim}
\item[] {\bf Reason:} Developer package configuration was updated with
  the experiment software package.  The experiment monotone server
  must be created and started manually.
\item[] {\bf Impact:} All repositories (includes the experiment
  repository) should be up and running again.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Mando
\item[] {\bf Date:} 8/10/2010 
\item[] {\bf Actions:} Started installation of repository software.
\item[] {\bf Reason:} Repository machine was reinstalled.
\item[] {\bf Impact:} N/A
\end{itemize}


\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Hugo
\item[] {\bf Date:} 8/10/2010 
\item[] {\bf Actions:} Check if the repo was already reinstalled.
\item[] {\bf Reason:} Check if the repo was already reinstalled.
\item[] {\bf Impact:} None.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Mando
\item[] {\bf Date:} 8/9/2010 
\item[] {\bf Actions:} Restarted monotone repositories.
\item[] {\bf Reason:} Userdocs repository got "stuck"
\item[] {\bf Impact:} N/A
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Mando
\item[] {\bf Date:} 8/9/2010 
\item[] {\bf Actions:} Backed up system and data files.
\item[] {\bf Reason:} Need the files to set up the server after reinstallation.
\item[] {\bf Impact:} N/A
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Mando
\item[] {\bf Date:} 7/9/2010 
\item[] {\bf Actions:} Started monotone server, removed old 32-bit RPM files and directories to upload newer versions, and did an integrity check on the server.
\item[] {\bf Reason:} Server had a new hard drive installed and rebuilt the RAID so needed to start the monotone server that does not start on boot and make sure it was running properly. 
\item[] {\bf Impact:} N/A
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Mando
\item[] {\bf Date:} 7/6/2010
\item[] {\bf Actions:} Removed old Mac OSX NS-SLI package from the downloadable area.
\item[] {\bf Reason:}   Package has a known bug in determining the execution path. 
\item[] {\bf Impact:} Should not affect Repository or Tester operations.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Mando
\item[] {\bf Date:} 7/2/2010 
\item[] {\bf Actions:} Removed simrc file in g3tester home directory after fixing the problem with finding the simrc in the executable directory.
\item[] {\bf Reason:} The .simrc-ns-sli file in the home directory was masking a bug in determining the simrc file in the executable directory. 
\item[] {\bf Impact:} Removing the file will allow the tests to continue with a file that is under monotone control.
\end{itemize}





\subsection*{darwin.cbi.utsa.edu}

This machine hosts the GENESIS website as well as the output from the user documentation system. All of this is done through a single non-root user account named \'genesis\'.

\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Mando
\item[] {\bf Date:} 7/12/2010
\item[] {\bf Reason:} Need to update website to search through userdocs. 
\item[] {\bf Actions:} Made some changes to the website software that was to allow searching through all imported html files with the intent that it would allow quick searches through userdocs.  
\item[] {\bf Impact:} Did not go as planned, the imported static html pages do not seem to be properly indexed in the site search. Needed to update the cron script to the newest version due to a new feature needed, this should not affect operations.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Mando
\item[] {\bf Date:} 7/10/2010
\item[] {\bf Reason:} Need to update website to search through userdocs. 
\item[] {\bf Actions:} Did work on the website software. 
\item[] {\bf Impact:} N/A
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Mando
\item[] {\bf Date:} 7/7/2010
\item[] {\bf Reason:} Need to add a sitemap to the userdocs.
\item[] {\bf Actions:} Did work on the website software. 
\item[] {\bf Impact:} N/A
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Mando
\item[] {\bf Date:} 7/6/2010
\item[] {\bf Reason:} Need to add some files to work with google custom search.
\item[] {\bf Actions:} Did work on the website software. 
\item[] {\bf Impact:} N/A
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Mando
\item[] {\bf Date:} 7/2/2010
\item[] {\bf Reason:} Website software and database needed updating.
\item[] {\bf Actions:} Did work on the website software. 
\item[] {\bf Impact:} N/A
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Mac Tester}

The Mac tester is an iMac machine located at {\bf CBI} that runs the tester on a cronjob. It is also used for debugging and building packages for 32-bit Mac OSX Snow Leopard.

System specs:
\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Processor:} 2 Ghz Intel Core Duo
\item[] {\bf Memory:} 2 GB 667 Mhz DDR2 SDRAM
\item[] {\bf Operating System:} Mac OSX Snow Leopard (Version 10.6.4) 
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Mando
\item[] {\bf Date:} 7/14/2010
\item[] {\bf Reason:} Prevent tester from performing unnecessary merging. 
\item[] {\bf Actions:} Turn on the \"no automated merges\" feature in the developer package.
\item[] {\bf Impact:} N/A
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Mando
\item[] {\bf Date:} 7/12/2010
\item[] {\bf Reason:} Tester is "stuck" due to a bug in monotone that causes a merge conflict.
\item[] {\bf Actions:} Made a copy of the "stuck" monotone repositories and did a fresh pull. Since monotone version is 0.47, will check to see if this is a new bug or one that was previously fixed.
\item[] {\bf Impact:} Tester now proceeds as normal. 
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\bf Admin:} Mando
\item[] {\bf Date:} 7/6/2010
\item[] {\bf Reason:} Allow more developers to see test runs on the mac.
\item[] {\bf Actions:} Added Hugo to the Mac Tester email.
\item[] {\bf Impact:} N/A
\end{itemize}
