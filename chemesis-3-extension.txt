Some details of the implementation
----------------------------------

Different numerical solution methods are required to solve the different
types of mathematical equations associated with different scales of
modeling.  The cable equation and ion currents are numerically solved with
implicit Crank-Nicolson integration.  In G-3 this method of solution is
implemented in a dedicated compartmental solver called Heccer.  In the G-3
shell the user has to create a mapping from the name of the neuron model to
the solver.  In the past, this was not necessary, as Heccer was the only
solver.  Under planned extensions to the G-shell syntax, the correct syntax
for a loaded single neuron model with name "/traub94" would be::

  genesis > solverset "/traub94 => heccer"

Biochemical pathways in neuronal modeling are complex networks of
interacting ion concentration pools.  The G-3 implementation for
simulation of biochemical pathways is called Chemesis-3 and has a
dedicated optimized implementation to represent networks parameterized
with biochemical pathways.  To simulate a complex network model of
biochemical pathways, in this example called "/cal1", a user would
typically type from the G-3 shell::

  genesis > solverset "/cal1 => chemesis3"

In case the network of biochemical pathways is defined inside the
single neuron model, a user would have to type two commands with
wildcards that associate the correct solver with each component of the
model, for example::

  genesis > solverset "/**/cal1 => chemesis3"
  genesis > solverset "/traub94/**[!cal1] => heccer"

In later version of G-3 these rules will be built in but still allow
the user to select a different method of solution for different
components of his or her model.


Extending GENESIS-3
-------------------

The G-3 documentation systems describes the procedures used for G-3
extension.  Extending G-3 can involve the implementation of a new
solver, or, when the required functionality is tangential to an
existing solver, it can require source code additions to an
pre-existing software component.  Here we describe the integration of
a new solver, ie. the steps followed for the implementation of
Chemesis-3.

  1. The developer package integrates the different software
  components of G-3.  The definition of a new component "chemesis3" in
  the developer package allows for its smooth integration with other
  G-3 software components such as the model-container.

  2. The implementation of the core of a new solver is independent of
  the development of other software components.  This allows full
  focus on the mathematic aspects of the solver and their
  implementation.

  3. Optionally, the model-container can be extended with new tokens
  that are specific to the new solver.  Configuration of the
  model-container defines the new tokens and their parameters.

  4. An interface must be written between the model-container and
  the core of the solver.  The model-container defines an API that
  makes abstraction of the biological structure the model.
