* userdocs_cron::set_index_page()
Has code that duplicates functionality already in userdocs-tag-replace
items.  It also has functionality that is related to framing, so this
functionality should be merged somehow with the
GENESIS3::Documentation::Document::expand() subroutine.

* version-control
Has a hyperlink to self.  Figure out what is going on.

* Add tags to the test specification of all packages
And use them to link pages of different documentation levels together
in index pages.
