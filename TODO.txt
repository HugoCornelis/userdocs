* userdocs_cron::set_index_page()
** Has code that duplicates functionality already in userdocs-tag-replace items.
** It also has functionality that is related to framing
so this functionality should be merged somehow with the
GENESIS3::Documentation::Document::expand() subroutine.
** The titles generated by set_index_page() currently don't make sense for a global listing.
So we need to come up with a new tag in descriptor.yml for this purpose.

* version-control
Has a hyperlink to self.  Figure out what is going on.

* Add tags to the test specification of all packages
And use them to link pages of different documentation levels together
in index pages.  The prefix for such tags should be 'test-'.

* tags that are related to build stages
** draft, published ao.
** should reflect at what stage to bail out from the build process
*** loosely based on the documentation build code in Documentation.pm.
**** build_copy: bail out after copying to and preparing the output/ directory.
**** build_expand: bail out after contents and snippet expansion.
**** build_compile: bail out after compiling the document.
**** build_publish: bail out after copying it to the published directory.
