* userdocs_cron::set_index_page()
** Has code that duplicates functionality already in userdocs-tag-replace items.
** It also has functionality that is related to framing
so this functionality should be merged somehow with the
GENESIS3::Documentation::Document::expand() subroutine.
** The titles generated by set_index_page() currently don't make sense for a global listing.
So we need to come up with a new tag in descriptor.yml for this purpose.

* version-control
Has a hyperlink to self.  Figure out what is going on.

* Add tags to the test specification of all packages
And use them to link pages of different documentation levels together
in index pages.
