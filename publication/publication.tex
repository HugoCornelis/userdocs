\section*{The GENESIS Publication System}

A powerful feature of the GENESIS software system is the capacity to track the life cycle of a research project, from creation through development and extension to publication.

\subsection*{Introduction}

The following figure illustrates the global workflows and dataflows that support the GENESIS publication system.

\subsection*{Classes of Publication}

The following classes of publication are currently recognized within the GENESIS software platform and have individual workflows to support the publication workflow illustrated above.

\begin{enumerate}
   \item {\bf Document Publication:}
   \item {\bf Tutorial Publication:}
   \item {\bf Model Publication:} A model publication is the publication of a family of mathematical models and their interpretation, usually as annotations to the family of mathematical models. The mathematical models can be run using a simulator where annotations explain their functional components, their relationships, data outputs, and analysis. A model publication can in turn be converted to a tutorial publication.
   \item{\bf Project Publication:} This is the most general class of publication. The G3 \href{../workflow-user/workflow-user.tex}{\bf User\,Workflow} defines iterators that close the loop between the steps of the user workflow to deliver a GENESIS project. A GENESIS project can be defined as  a model publication but the reverse is not necessarily true. For example, a project publication can be a publication about data mining of the publication database.
   \item \href{../publication-review/publication-review.tex}{\bf Publication\,Submission\,and\,Review}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Annotation}

Many simple aspects of the GENESIS Publication System can be automated, whereas, this is not the case when processing output specific to a given project. This leads to two classes of annotation that are iterative in the sense that the process will be repeated many times:

\begin{enumerate}
   \item {\bf Automated Annotations:} Automated model annotation can be created for aspects of simulation output such as plotting the time course of channel activation and inactivation.
   \item {\bf Manual Annotations:} Manual model annotation is required for the specific analysis of results that lead to interpretation of model behavior.
\end{enumerate}
