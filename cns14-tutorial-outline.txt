* introduction

** format of this tutorial

*** three simultaneous narratives
**** scale narrative (from biochemical pathways upto networks)
**** technological narrative
**** data vs control narrative

*** hands-on whenever you want to (I don't need to be hands-on unless you do).
*** questions at any time
*** format is flexible, including the section 'format of this tutorial'

** what is the GENESIS project?
(10 minutes)

25 years ago, we introduced a modeling system (GENESIS) specifically with the intent to start to build an infrastructure (as a community i.e. one of the first open source modeling platforms out there), so that people could share models leading to community models and start to use these models as a way to communicate and collaborate.

*** history slide
**** modeling instigated by neuroscience questions
**** from the outset a federated simulator architecture allowing user extension
**** community driven, with possible divergence of tracks of development

** simulator capabilities overview
(10 minutes)

*** single neuron modeling and neurokit
*** network modeling
*** kinetikit and chemesis
*** parameter searching
*** object oriented approach with G-2 scripts
*** architecture

** resources
(10 minutes)
*** website
*** papers
*** online manuals and documentation
**** BoG
**** builtin documentation (help command)
**** reference manual for technical information
*** tutorials about neuroscience
*** simulator
*** tutorials about the simulator
*** UGTD2-CNS to go with this CNS tutorial
*** installation and other stuff to get started

25 years ago, we introduced a modeling system (GENESIS) specifically with the intent to start to build an infrastructure (as a community i.e. one of the first open source modeling platforms out there), so that people could share models leading to community models and start to use the models (rather than story telling) as a way to communicate and collaborate.  (Remember the Rochester connectionist simulator - similar idea).
