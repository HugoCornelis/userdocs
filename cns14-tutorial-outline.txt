** what is the GENESIS project?
(10 minutes)

25 years ago, we introduced a modeling system (GENESIS) specifically with the intent to start to build an infrastructure (as a community i.e. one of the first open source modeling platforms out there), so that people could share models leading to community models and start to use these models as a way to communicate and collaborate.

25 years ago, we introduced a modeling system (GENESIS) specifically with the intent to start to build an infrastructure (as a community i.e. one of the first open source modeling platforms out there), so that people could share models leading to community models and start to use the models (rather than story telling) as a way to communicate and collaborate.  (Remember the Rochester connectionist simulator - similar idea).
