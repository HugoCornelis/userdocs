** what is the genesis project?
(10 minutes)

25 years ago, we introduced a modeling system (GENESIS) specifically with the intent to start to build an infrastructure (as a community i.e. one of the first open source modeling platforms out there), so that people could share models leading to community models and start to use the models (rather than story telling) as a way to communicate and collaborate.  (Remember the Rochester connectionist simulator - similar idea).

*** history slide
*** a modeling answer to neuroscience questions
*** modeling instigated by neuroscience questions
*** from the outset a federated software architecture allowing user extension
*** community driven, with divergence of development tracks
