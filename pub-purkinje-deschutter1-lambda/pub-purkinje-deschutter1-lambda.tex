\section*{De Schutter: Purkinje Cell Model}

\subsection*{Effect of active membrane on the electrical properties of Purkinje cells}
\subsection*{CHANNEL ACTIVATION AND ELECTROTONIC LENGTH}

We have used the model to contrast the electrical properties of apassive Purkinje cell dendrite with those of a dendrite withthe active properties just described.\href{../pub-purkinje-deschutter1-fig-12/pub-purkinje-deschutter1-fig-12.tex}{\bf Figure 12} shows the effect of including voltage-dependentconductance on the electrotonic structure of themodel. In this figure, Sholl diagrams\,\cite{Sholl:1953kl} are presentedin units of electrotonic length of the Purkinje cellunder different conditions. At the right side, enlargementsshow the electrotonic lengths of a few distal branchlets in apassive membrane model (no active conductances in themodel; \href{../pub-purkinje-deschutter1-fig-12/pub-purkinje-deschutter1-fig-12.tex}{\bf Fig.\,12{\it B}}) and in an active membrane model duringand after a dendritic spike. One can see that adding activemembrane to the cell roughly doubled its electrotonic sizeduring the resting state shown in \href{../pub-purkinje-deschutter1-fig-12/pub-purkinje-deschutter1-fig-12.tex}{\bf\,Fig. 12{\it C}} (the dendriticmembrane had a potential of about -60\,mV) and that duringa dendritic spike the electrotonic size was roughly doubledagain (\href{../pub-purkinje-deschutter1-fig-12/pub-purkinje-deschutter1-fig-12.tex}{\bf Fig.\,12{\it D}}). The electrotonic distance from thesoma to the marked dendritic tip (morphological distance392\,$\mu$m) was 0.57\,$\lambda$ in the passive model; it was 0.95\,$\lambda$ in theactive model in the resting state and 1.57\,$\lambda$ in the activemodel during the dendritic spike.
