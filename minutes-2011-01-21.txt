I would like to set up a conference call between the three of us to
consider where we are, and what needs to happen between now and July
to have a releasable version of G-3 ready to go.

Need to line up for grant production - and general production and so
would be good to touch base, now that I am back in San Antonio and
will be basically for several months.
