\subsection*{CURRENTS IN THE MAIN DENDRITE}

The currents in the main dendrite were a mixture of somatic and dendriticcurrents, and like the membrane potential they combinedthe characteristics of both parts of the cell in their dynamicchanges (\href{../pub-purkinje-deschutter1-fig-11/pub-purkinje-deschutter1-fig-11.tex}{\bf Fig.\,11{\it B}}). Two aspects are noteworthy. The CaPchannel in the main dendrite was activated during the somaticaction potential and thus contributed to the broadenedbase of these Na$^+$ spikes. Correspondingly, there weresmall activations of the Ca$^{2+}$ -activated K$^+$ currents duringeach somatic spike. However, the delayed rectifier was amore important current in the main dendrite during thedepolarizing spike burst than the K2 current.
