\section*{Common Filename Suffixes used by GENESIS}

GENESIS knows about many different file formats.  These file formats
are commonly distinguished by appending a common suffix to the
filename.  GENESIS knows about the following suffixes:

\begin{enumerate}

\item {\bf .evl} A file that contains the time stamps of a series of events.
\item {\bf .g3p} A GENESIS 3 project file.
\item {\bf .g3} A file format that contains gshell commands.
\item {\bf .g} A file format that contains GENESIS 2 SLI commands.
\item {\bf .ndf} The Neurospaces Description Format used by the model-container to describe models.
\item {\bf .nms} A binary file format that contains the state of a simulation.
\item {\bf .nxf} An XML representation of the {\bf .ndf} format.  Both the {\bf .nxf} and the {\bf .ndf} formats describe the same type of information.
\item {\bf .out} A file with simulation output.
\item {\bf .per} A file format that describes the state of the G-Tube, describing a perspective on a simulation project.
\item {\bf .p} A morphology file of the GENESIS 2 SLI.
\item {\bf .ssp} A configuration file for the SSP scheduler.

\end{enumerate}
