\section*{GENESIS: Documentation}

\section{The TODO and the DONE List}

This document contains a list of functions and descriptions that need
to be implemented or incorporated in the software or software
infrastructure.  The level of detail of the descriptions can vary
between items.  After an item is described, it can be followed by a
checklist with information of the level of implementation.  For
example, subitems in the checklist can be marked with the word 'DONE'.

This document can grow when people add new functions that await
implementation, and it can be consolidated by moving items that have
been completed from the TODO list to the DONE list.  Some functions
are related to maintenance and they never disappear (such as Packaging
and Distribution).  They can be marked with 'WORKING'.

This TODO list was built at \today, \thistime.


\section{TODO List}

\subsection{Packaging and Distribution}

Packaging involves the creation of tarballs with source code to the
creation of binary packages for different OSs.

For packaging and distribution of the alpha release of GENESIS 3.0,
each software component must contain the following makefile targets:

\begin{itemize}
\item 'dist': for creation of the tarball with source code.
\item 'pkg-deb': for creation of a binary archive for debian based
  Linux distributions (including Ubuntu).
\item 'pkg-rpm': for creation of a binary archive for rpm based Linux
  distributions (such as Redhat and Fedora).
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Benchmarking}

Test the performance of the Purkinje cell in each of the following
environments:

\begin{itemize}
\item GENESIS 2 (old GENESIS 2 enviroment).
\item NS-SLI (GENESIS 3 - GENESIS 2 backward compatibility).
\item SSP (GENESIS 3 batch simulation environment).
\item gshell (GENESIS 3 interactive simulation environment).
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Report Document for Testers}

Construct a report document with instructions for alpha and beta
testers.  The instructions consist of installation instructions and a
questionnaire about basic application functionality.

\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Level 4 Documentation: Technical Specifications}

For each software component a set of (html) documents must be
generated that specify the capabilities of the component.  For Unix
shell scripts, technical specifications can be generated from the
usage messages generated by a '--help' argument.

\subsection{Level 3-7 Documentation: Creation Guide}

An outline of how Level 3-7 documentation is created and included in
the appropriate locations is required.


\subsection{Document Dependencies}

Perl dependencies:
\begin{itemize}
\item YAML
\item Clone
\item Data::Utilities
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Progress Reports to the Supplement}

Every three months a report about progress on the work of the
administrative supplement must be submitted to NIH.

\subsection{Add Network Modeling Support}

Because this is an important function, it requires substantial
development on one software component, and also impacts other software
components.

\begin{itemize}
\item DES
  \begin{itemize}
  \item instantiation of DES queuer stand-alone (DONE)
  \item instantiation of DES distributor stand-alone (DONE)
  \item tests of DES stand-alone (DONE)
  \end{itemize}
\item model-container
  \begin{itemize}
  \item instantiation of projections / connections by model-container (DONE)
  \item inspection of projections / connections by model-container API (DONE)
  \end{itemize}
\item SSP
  \begin{itemize}
  \item instantiation of DES queuer from ssp (partial)
  \item instantiation of DES distributor from ssp (partial)
  \item translation of model-container connections to DES connections (partial)
  \item tests for ssp
  \end{itemize}
\item gshell
  \begin{itemize}
  \item add integration commands to gshell
  \item tests for gshell
  \end{itemize}
\item backward compatibility
  \begin{itemize}
  \item integration of planar / volume connect command
  \item tests for backward compatibility
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Unify the Methods of Handling of Inputs to a Model}

There are several fundamentally different ways to specify inputs to a
simulated model from the gshell.  For example, a voltage clamp
protocol is specified by creating input objects (pclamp object).  A
current injection and endogeneous stimulation is specified by setting
parameters.

\subsection{GUI: Construct Model}

\begin{itemize}
\item Import from External Library:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item displaying ndf library is working
  \item Get the gui read from external libraries on the net.
  \item Add support for different file types like swc.
  \end{itemize}
\item Load Tutorial: display a list of clickable tutorial links and
  have the gui open them ia web browser of html widget.
\item Load Project: Get gui to load a project based on a yaml file
  which includes all relevant input and result files.
\item Create Model: Create interface to allow a user to create a
  simple model via text and/or graphics.
\item Explore Model: Create a graphics widget which displays the
  morphology when clicking "explore model"
\item Save Model: Get save model to work properly (save a project file
  as well as all included files)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{GUI: Design Experiment}
\begin{itemize}
\item Choose Inputs: create a menu of selectable inputs from the loaded model.
\item Choose Outputs: create a menu of selectable outputs from the loaded model.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{GUI: Run Simulation}
\begin{itemize}
\item CHECK: appears to be working.
\item RUN: appears to be working.      
\item STOP: Get "stop" simulation to properly work (not sure how this
  will work since the gshell is stop and wait).
\item RESET: Get reset functionality to work.
\item SAVE: Save model state.
\item LOAD: Get gui to load a previous save state.
\item Runtime Option: create a menu for adding runtime options.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{GUI: Output}
\begin{itemize}
\item Plot: Get plot to take parameters from the simulation to fill in
  the legend, X and Y axis as well as the title of a graph.
\item Studio: Remove Studio from output menu? Same functionality will be in "Explore Model."
\item Matlab: Create export menu/functionality for matlab.
\item xmgrace:Create export menu/functionality for xmgrace.
\item Mathematica: create export menu/functionality for Mathematica.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{GUI: Iterators}
Add menus/functionality to the iterator menu.

Put a couple of iterator scripts of the purkinje cell comparison and
the mutual information projects in a directory.  The Iterators menu
lists all the scripts found in this directory, clicking on one of them
runs the appropriate script.  The script generates ssp configuration
files that can be loaded into the GUI.


\subsection{GUI: Other}
\begin{itemize}
\item Finish yaml loader to load the clickable graphic complete with
  roll overs dynamically.
\item Have the gui use a "project" file which will track various
  aspects of a users project.
\item Get "compileall" script to work and make python byte code for
  various distros.
\item Have gui track Workflow state and guide user accordingly.
\item Screenshot functionality for plot and explore model.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{gshell}
\begin{itemize}
\item Implement the ssp\_save and ssp\_load commands.
\item Complete the link with python.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{model-container}
Complete the implementation of the ndf\_save command.  Add tests for
saving a full model, saving a library of models and saving a
modularized part of a model.

\section{DONE List}

\subsection{Monotone Clone Operation Integration with the Installer Scripts}
Integrate 'mtn clone' into the installer scripts (DONE).
