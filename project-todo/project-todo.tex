\section*{GENESIS: Documentation}

\section{The TODO and the DONE List}

This document contains a list of functions and descriptions that need
to be implemented or incorporated in the software or software
infrastructure.  The level of detail of the descriptions can vary
between items.  After an item is described, it can be followed by a
checklist with information of the level of implementation.  For
example, subitems in the checklist can be marked with the word `DONE'.

This document can grow when people add new functions that await
implementation, and it can be consolidated by moving items that have
been completed from the TODO list to the DONE list.
%  Some functions
%are related to maintenance and they never disappear (such as Packaging
%and Distribution).  They can be marked with 'WORKING'.

This TODO list was built on \today, \thistime.


\section{TODO List}

\subsection{Packaging and Distribution (for the alpha1 Release)}

Packaging involves the creation of tarballs with source code to the
creation of binary packages for different OSs.

For packaging and distribution of the alpha release of GENESIS\,3.0,
each software component must implement the following makefile targets:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\it dist}: for creation of the tarball with source code.
  Create an installer script that builds the tarball of each package
  (neurospaces\_dist) (DONE).
\item {\it pkg-deb}: for creation of a binary archive for debian based
  Linux distributions (including Ubuntu).
\item {\it pkg-rpm}: for creation of a binary archive for rpm based Linux
  distributions (such as Redhat and Fedora).
\item MAC .dmg file.
\end{itemize}

An additional package must be created that has all other software
components of GENESIS\,3 as dependencies.  An installer script must
be created that builds all the OS specific archives and puts them in a
common directory (neurospaces\_dist\_archives).

\subsection{Benchmarking}

Test the performance of the Purkinje cell in each of the following
environments:

\begin{itemize}
\item GENESIS\,2 (old GENESIS\,2 enviroment).
\item NS-SLI (GENESIS\,3--GENESIS\,2 backward compatibility).
\item SSP (GENESIS\,3 batch simulation environment).
\item G-Shell (GENESIS\,3 interactive simulation environment).

developers.

  \end{tabular}
}



\subsection{Report Document for Testers}

Construct a report document with instructions for alpha and beta
testers.  The instructions consist of installation instructions and a
questionnaire about basic application functionality.

Questionnaire must be put on the website.

\subsection{Demonstration Scripts}

The following scripts have been selected for use as demonstration
scripts:

\begin{itemize}
\item Purkinje Cell Scripts from Erik De Schutter: some of the scripts
  are used for regression tests (and work correctly).  Other Purkinje
  cell scripts still need validation.
\item Rallpacks: for benchmarking it would be useful to implement
  scripts for the rallpack standard.  To show the relationships
  between the different GENESIS\,3 interfaces, it is useful to
  implement these scripts in the different interfaces currently
  available (Perl, Python, NS-SLI, NDF, Heccer, G-Shell).

  For visibility and good integration with the rest of the system, it
  would be best to integrate these scripts with the regression tester,
  such that they are validated and documented on a daily basis.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Rallpack 1: Passive unbranched cable.
  \item Rallpack 2: Branched cable.
  \item Rallpack 3: Squid axon/Active cable.
  \item Integrate with Tests.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Level 4 Documentation: Technical Specifications}

shell scripts, technical specifications can be generated from the
usage messages generated by a `--help' argument.


\subsection{Level 3-7 Documentation: Creation Guide}

An outline of how Level 3-7 documentation is created and included in
the appropriate locations is required.  A level 2 document.


\subsection{Documentation Browsing}

Tag all the documentation with keywords to define flows through the
documentation and ease browsing and reading of related documents.

Should be provided via a browser-based framework to give `professional' look to documentation. See Documentation Framing (following).


\subsection{Documentation Framing}

Look and feel of documentation website.

\subsection{Progress Reports to the Supplement}

Every three months a report about progress on the work of the
administrative supplement must be submitted to NIH.

This can be done by picking items from the DONE list related to the
work proposed in the administrative supplement.

First move conceptualized items from the supplement to this TODO list.


\subsection{Unify the Methods of Handling of Inputs to a Model}

There are several fundamentally different ways to specify inputs to a
simulated model from the G-Shell.  For example, a voltage clamp
protocol is specified by creating input objects (pclamp object).  A
current injection and endogeneous stimulation is specified by setting
parameters.


\subsection{Announce GENESIS\,3 alpha1}

Compose an announcement of the GENESIS\,3 alpha1 release to the
connectionist, compneuro and genesis-users email lists.  Signed with
