  - Laid off from work.
  - Free lance or fixed contract?
  - Consultancy for other laboratories?
    - Writing simulations for other labs.
    - G-3 not yet ready for this, but good idea...
    - Cards: freelance person helping your model in G-3.
- Dave: Servers
  - Jim: register.com?
    - genesis-sim.org
      - another year

      - another year
    - hypothelia
  - switch to namecheap?
    - Mando will look into it.
- Grant: october.
- CNS: Dave and Mando working on CNS poster.
  - GUI for single cell simulations.
    - Dave provides images.
    - Tutorials.
    - Dave asks explicit feedback.
      - Std. demo for single cell modeling ao.
      - See Dave's email June 21st.
  - Why is G-3 interesting?
    - Multi-scale and flexibility.
      - cal8.ndf
      - RSnet
  - Christof and Daphne coming.
    - Promoting workshop.
    - Talk about poster.
  - Related to Multi-scale workshop.
    - Based on grant.
      - What is responsible for PC dying during normal aging?
      - What is the role of cerebellar syn. plast.?
      - 1. due to 2.
    - 1969: syn. plast. what PF do to PCs?
      - Technological challenges for this project?
        - G-3 specific.
        - PyMoose and other solutions.
    - The sexes problem... :-)
- The cal2.ndf problem.
  - Hugo looks into it tomorrow.
- Simplifying syntax for network simulations.
  - neuroml / nineml / pymoose based.
- Schedules:
  - Jim's schedule.
  - Dave's schedule, vacation till 10th.
- Dave asks explicit feedback.
  - Std. demo for single cell modeling ao.
  - See Dave's email June 21st.
  - Tutorials designed for tutorial writers.
    - and for researchers / hackers.
    - no steep learning curve.
  - Tutorials with separation between statements for
    - simulation
    - GUI
- Luebeck workshop
  - Dave may come, undecided.
  - Every agrees Luebeck workshop is high importance.
- Single neuron construction from parts of other cells.
  - Difficult to do.
  - Not discussed so far.
  - Same for chemesis3.
  - Can be done with NeuroML.
  - sli_load / ndf_save.
  - The gshell commands for ndf's input / bindings.
  - Examples available in chemesis2.
