\section*{De Schutter: Purkinje Cell Model}

\subsection*{RESPONSE TO DENDRITIC CURRENT INJECTIONS}

The model was also able to replicate previously reported responses todirect current injection into Purkinje cell dendrites (\href{../pub-purkinje-deschutter1-fig-7/pub-purkinje-deschutter1-fig-7.tex}{\bf Fig.7}). As in the physiological recordings, low-amplitudecurrent injection resulted only in attenuated somaticspikes, whereas these spikes were interrupted by dendriticCa$^{2+}$ spikes with larger current injections. Under these circumstancesthe onset of the bursting behavior was almostimmediate as compared with somatic recordings. Note alsothe burst occurring after the end of the 2.0\,nA current injection.
