\section{The TODO and the DONE List}

This document contains a list of functions and descriptions that need
to be implemented or incorporated in the software or software
infrastructure.  The level of detail of the descriptions can vary
between items.  After an item is described, it can be followed by a
checklist with information of the level of implementation.  For
example, subitems in the checklist can be marked with the word `DONE'.

This document can grow when people add new functions that await
implementation, and it can be consolidated by moving items that have
been completed from the TODO list to the DONE list.  Items are never
removed from the DONE list.
%  Some functions
%are related to maintenance and they never disappear (such as Packaging
%and Distribution).  They can be marked with 'WORKING'.

This TODO list was built on \today, \thistime.


\section{G-3 Release TODO List}

\subsection{Add Network Modeling Support}

Network modeling support still requires substantial development on one
software component, and also impacts other software components.

\begin{itemize}
\item DES
  \begin{itemize}
  \item instantiation of DES queuer stand-alone (DONE)
  \item instantiation of DES distributor stand-alone (DONE)
  \item tests of DES stand-alone (DONE)
  \end{itemize}
\item model-container
  \begin{itemize}
  \item instantiation of projections/connections by model-container (DONE)
  \item inspection of projections/connections by model-container API (DONE)
  \end{itemize}
\item SSP
  \begin{itemize}
  \item instantiation of DES queuer from SSP (partial)
  \item instantiation of DES distributor from SSP (partial)
  \item translation of model-container connections to DES connections (partial)
  \item tests for SSP
  \end{itemize}
\item G-Shell
  \begin{itemize}
  \item add integration commands to G-Shell
  \item tests for G-Shell
  \end{itemize}
\item backward compatibility
  \begin{itemize}
  \item integration of planar/volume connect command
  \item tests for backward compatibility
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{center}


\subsection{symmetric compartments (1)}

Implement symmetric compartments.  We will have to decide how to do
this: core implementation, or converting each symmetric compartment to
two asymmetric compartments.  This will also likely involve core
design decisions, because the model-container does not distinguish
between symmetric and asymmetric compartments (only the solvers do).

\subsection{Simulator Performance Benchmarking}

Performance Benchmarking is traditionally classified in phases of
model-construction time and simulation run-time.  Test the performance
of the Purkinje cell in each of the following environments:

\begin{itemize}
\item GENESIS\,2 (old GENESIS\,2 enviroment).  What is the time taken
  by the simulator to run 1 second of simulation in G-2?
\item NS-SLI (GENESIS\,3--GENESIS\,2 backward compatibility).  What is
  the time taken when running 1 second of simulation in G-3 using the
  the NS-SLI module to read the original G-2 scripts that encode the
  Purkinje cell model?
\item SSP (GENESIS\,3 batch simulation environment).  What is the time
  taken when running 1 second of simulation in G-3 from a UNIX shell
  command line with the Purkinje cell model encoded in NDF format?
\item G-Shell (GENESIS\,3 interactive simulation environment).  What
  is the time taken when running 1 second of simulation in G-3 from
  the interactive G-3 shell with the Purkinje cell model encoded in
  NDF format?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Demonstration Scripts}

The following scripts have been selected for use as demonstration
scripts:

\begin{itemize}
\item Purkinje Cell Scripts from Erik De Schutter: some of the scripts
  are used for regression tests (and work correctly).  Other Purkinje
  cell scripts still need validation (DONE).
\item Rallpacks: for benchmarking it would be useful to implement
  scripts for the rallpack standard.  To show the relationships
  between the different GENESIS\,3 interfaces, it is useful to
  implement these scripts in the different interfaces currently
  available (Perl, Python, NS-SLI, NDF, Heccer, G-Shell).

  For visibility and good integration with the rest of the system, it
  would be best to integrate these scripts with the regression tester,
  such that they are validated and documented on a daily basis.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Rallpack 1: Passive unbranched cable.
  \item Rallpack 2: Branched cable.
  \item Rallpack 3: Squid axon/Active cable.
  \item Integrate with Tests.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Report Document for Testers}

Construct a report document with instructions for alpha and beta
testers.  The instructions consist of installation instructions and a
questionnaire about basic application functionality.

Questionnaire must be put on the website.

\end{center}


\subsection{Packaging and Distribution (for the alpha1 Release)}

Packaging involves the creation of tarballs with source code to the
creation of binary packages for different OSs.

For packaging and distribution of the alpha release of GENESIS\,3.0,
each software component must implement the following makefile targets:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\it dist}: for creation of the tarball with source code.
  Create an installer script that builds the tarball of each package
  (neurospaces\_dist) (DONE).
\item {\it pkg-deb}: for creation of a binary archive for debian based
  Linux distributions (including Ubuntu). - (DONE)
\item {\it pkg-rpm}: for creation of a binary archive for rpm based Linux
  distributions (such as Redhat and Fedora). - (IN PROGRESS - 90\%)
\item MAC .dmg file. - (IN PROGRESS)
\end{itemize}

An additional package must be created that has all other software
components of GENESIS\,3 as dependencies.  An installer script must
be created that builds all the OS specific archives and puts them in a
common directory (neurospaces\_dist\_archives).

Communicate with the previous debian maintainers about this.  They are
Sam Hocevar (Debian packages) sam+deb at zoy.org and Matt Zimmerman
mdz at csh.rit.edu

  \end{tabular}
\end{center}


\subsection{Daily Releases and Release Labels}

The installer scripts can update the release labels in the source code
automatically, and check them in into the source code repositories.
The checkin should be done on a branch 'dist' to prevent contamination
of the default '0' branch with versions that reconfigure the software
with new release labels.

The checkin should be made visible from the repository server (ie. the
tester should push its changes from its repository to the server
repository).

\subsection{Source code Configuration}

Fix automake scripts to detect different operating systems 
and build makefiles accordingly:


\begin{itemize}
\item {\it Fedora 11}: Compensate for libhistory being built into the
  installed libc.
\item {\it BSD}: Not currently supported.
\item {\it Solaris 10}: Not currently supported.

\subsection{Model\,Container}

saving a full model, saving a library of models and saving a
modularized part of a model.

\end{center}

\begin{itemize}
\item there is now an export library function in the model-container
  that exports all the components of a model in the private model
  section of an NDF file.
\item The model is then trivially instantiated in the public model
  section.
\item There is also an export all function in the model-container that
  can save a modularized part of a model (but you loose the
  relationships between individual model components).
\item The gshell ndf\_save command is trivially linked to the export
  library function.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{SSP Optimizer}

The SSP optimizer uses the perl Inline module to inline C code with
perl code.  The Inline module creates a directory hierarchy inside the
current directory to do its work.  The Inline module must be
configured to do this in a standard directory, where all users share
the result.

The installation of SSP must run SSP to do the compilation of the
optimizer, and install it afterwards.  This is to avoid race
conditions between simultaneously running ssp processes.
