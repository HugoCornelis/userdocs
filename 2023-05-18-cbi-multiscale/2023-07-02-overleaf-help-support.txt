Hi,

A colleague and I are trying out Overleaf for editing of a scientific manuscript.

Everything worked reasonably well until the 'Journal of Multiscale Neuroscience' asked to use a specific template for their journal.

When we download the 'cornelis-coop-msns-3.tex' file to our laptops and use the journal's template, the latex compiles fine and a PDF is generated.

Overleaf finds the template but refuses to generate a PDF for 'cornelis-coop-msns-3.tex'.  A fatal error is produced at line 113 at the first 'section' command.

Is this something you can help us with please?

Thanks in advance.

Hugo
