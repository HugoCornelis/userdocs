It is not clear what the question of giant simulations is, given the scope of their contents.

Missing a scientific question is a waste of resources.


Relationship between methodology and scientific research.

Historical move from why-type of questions to how-type of questions.

G-3 tries to move back to why-type of questions.



Godel: the sorts of things we are investigating approaches the whole thing, so we cannot answer the why-type questions anymore.

As a consequence we move to the how-type of questions, the technological questions.



G-3 is a scale-independent framework for computational neuroscience that resolves the problems associated with multi-scale simulations.


What is it that is allowable as science?

This is the introduction.

* biology is not multi-scale
The conclusion could be: biology is scale independent.

** find examples
- cerebellar modeling, ascending segment synapse modulates cerebellar
  network output

The general principle comes from chaostheory and says that a small
change in a detail can change the state and consequently the output of
the entire system.

** link this with the necessity of grouping constructs in the model-container
The necessity to allow grouping modeling elements and define /
identify the inputs and outputs of these groups to connect these
inputs and outputs with modeling elements at a lower scale.

The function of grouping of elements into cognitive concepts goes
beyond what is strictly mathematically required.

examples:
- projections as groups of connections
- granule cell groups as functional units wrt their ascending
  segments=
