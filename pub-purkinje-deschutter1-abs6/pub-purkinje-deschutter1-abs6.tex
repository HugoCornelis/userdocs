\section*{De Schutter: Purkinje Cell Model}

\subsection*{Abstract Item 6}

The model was used to compare the electrotonic length of
the Purkinje cell in the presence and absence of active dendritic
conductances. The electrotonic distance from soma to the tip of
the most distal dendrite increased from 0.57\,$\lambda$ in a passive model
to 0.95\,$\lambda$ in a quiet model with active membrane. During a dendritic
spike generated by current injection the distance increased
even more, to 1.57\,$\lambda$.
