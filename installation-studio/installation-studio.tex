\section*{Installation Mac OSX} (Not finished yet)

For Leopard (Mac OS X 10.5) you need to have Xcode 3.1 or later but before 3.2, a download link can be found \href{http://www.freemacware.com/freemacware-downloads/2755}{here}. Note that Xcode 3.2 will require Snow Leopard to install.


You will need the following software packages installed:

\begin{itemize}
\item[] Gtk2
\item[] glib2-devel (not sure but it may be included in Gtk2)
\end{itemize}

The only easy ways to install Gtk2 is through \href{http://www.macports.org/}{macports} or \href{http://www.finkproject.org/}{Fink}. Make sure that {\bf gtk-config} is in your path after installation so that {\bf Perl} Maker can see it when configuring bindings. 

\subsection*{Using Fink (Recommended)}

Open Fink Commander and install the binaries for: 

\begin{itemize}
	\item[] gtk+2
	\item[] gtk+2-dev
	\item[] glib2
	\item[] glib2-dev
	\item[] pango1
	\item[] pango1-dev
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Using Macports}

Using the port command provided by macports just install gtk2 as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
sudo /opt/local/bin/port install gtk2
\end{verbatim}

The installer should fetch all prerequisites for you.

\textcolor{red}{\bf Note} make sure that you do not use the {\bf macports} version of {\bf Perl} when building the Perl SWIG bindings. This can result in bus errors when trying to load even simple models.



\subsection*{Perl Dependencies}

Once gtk2 and glib2 is installed you can install the following {\bf Perl} modules from CPAN:

\begin{itemize}
\item[] Gtk2 (Rest of them should be installed )
\item[] Pango
\item[] Glib
\end{itemize}
