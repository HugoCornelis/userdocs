--------
LASCON

3 lecture and 5 tutorials genesis

dendrites are useful
python tutorial
overview of Genesis
modeling large networks 4 slides

5 short tutorials


STDP with a collaborator

4 NEST projects -> ModelDB
  python successful

3 Neuron
  python not great

3 Genesis

1 XPP XAut

Lugaro cell

Kristoph Metzner with woman Argentina auditor cortex model neuroconstruct neuron version
hsolve performance, then plasticity
problem: neuroconstruct code does not produce the original G-2 result.

original model G-2: 10 minutes
neuroconstruct models several hours.

UGTD has new additions, includes G-2

ready for CNS?

G-2 2.4 release?
- tutorial enhancements, see above.
- STDP with hsolve
- connections
  - planarconnect with probability for distance.

Saeed would like to put together a debian package.  G-3 developer package may be useful.

Jim busy selling his house etc.

Jim searching for new funding sources.

Mobile tutorial around G-3 for action propagation.

python interfacing popular / has lots of tools

OO based interfacing with hsolve is the problem, but runs 20 times faster

Saeed computer science teamed up with woman experimentalist

Avrama talked him into post synaptic potentials and Ca influx rather than a simpler model

genesis-sim.org should move to 

zhiwei position and CBI position are dicey, despite 400 users

other group has 3 users, but may win.

so genesis-sim.org should move asap.

Dave has login there has backup

G-tutorials 

new exercises, auditory cortex model Vogels-Abott improved wrt hsolve 20 times faster.

Vogels-Abott README about hsolve in networks

parameter search and tuning

powerpoint slides

CNS: overview in one day

consultancy job for hugo hopefully with enough vacation days

hsolve with new objects

Avrama's STDP synchan / variation of hebsynchan

Avrama may start using Moose

Dave next month, generalize LASCON tutorials, UGTD2

traub 2005 model is one dimensional no positions

last version of a tutorial may be useful project -- dave sends email
