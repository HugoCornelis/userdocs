\section*{De Schutter: Purkinje Cell Model}

\subsection*{Abstract}

In the presence of asynchronous inhibition, changes in the
average frequency of excitatory inputs modulated background simple
spike firing frequencies in the natural range of Purkinje cell
firing frequencies (30--100\,Hz). This modulation was very sensitive
to small changes in the average frequency of excitatory inputs.
In addition, changes in inhibitory frequency caused a parallel shift
of the relationship between excitatory input and spiking frequency.
Because of the specific cerebellar circuitry, inhibitory inputs
may allow Purkinje cells to detect small fluctuations in excitatory
input at any mean frequency of input.
