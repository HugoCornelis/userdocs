- hugo: two functions for network modeling still need implemented
  - syntax for creation of projections
  - stimulation of network models
- Dave: volumeconnect, createprojection
  - syntax
  - need for documentation about the distinction between these two
- Mando:
  - python supports named parameters for function volumeconnect.
- python bindings createprojection
  - only a couple of hours of work?
  - should be finished and working by tomorrow night.
- distribution of delays, weights.
  - incorporated in createprojection / volumeconnect
    - currently no need for separate commands as in G-2
  - workshop:
    - need fixed weights
    - need delay proportional to distance / velocity
      - need test scripts
        - Dave tests using netview
        - delays seems off in G-3 simulations
          - tested in model-container
          - tested by running simulations / DES inspection.
    - need for fixed delay
  - future:
    - exponential decay of weights with distance
    - exponential decay of connection probability
  - createprojection command
    - syntax offers the possibility for user-friendly extensions
- need for document about the createprojection command
  - and related concepts in both the model-container and the gshell
  - Hugo will do this.
  - map existing G-2 documentation to G-3 createprojection documentation?
  - clear understanding needed
    - what useful commands are
    - terminology about model components
    - choose between createprojection or volumeconnect
      - consistency needed for user.
- next call: early next week
  - Monday 11am San Antonio time.
  - Evaluate status of network modeling support.
  - Evaluate status of network modeling stimuli.
