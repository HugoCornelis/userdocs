   \caption{Activation and inactivation properties of the delayed rectifier current (Kdr, ---) in the model. Seady-state activation and inactivation vs. voltage are plotted at the {\em left}, the time constants of activation and inactivation($\tau_m$ and $\tau_h$) vs. voltage in the {\em middle} (Note: Semilogarithmic scale), and a simulation of representative voltage-clamp currents at the {\em right}.  The voltage clamps simulate steps from a holding potential of -110 to -70\,mV up to 0\,mV in 10\,mV increments. The voltage-clamp current amplitude has been scaled arbitrarily because we mainly wanted to demonstrate the current kinetics.}

\subsection*{Delayed Rectifier (Kdr)}

The Purkinje cell delayed rectifier (Kdr) is responsible for the repolarization of somatic action potentials. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings (Fig. 9 in\,\cite{Hirano:1989uq}) and patch-clamp recordings (Fig. 9 in\,\cite{Gahwiler:1989fk}) of the Kdr current are available but incomplete. The $I-V$ relations of the currents in both reports are very similar. In the current model we have used the published equations for Kdr current in bullfrog sympathetic ganglion cells\,\cite{Yamada-W:1989bs} because both the $I-V$ curve and the steady-state inactivation (Fig. 2E) of the bullfrog data are comparable with the data from\,\cite{Hirano:1989uq}.
