\section*{De Schutter: Purkinje Cell Model}

\subsection*{Abstract}

A detailed compartmental model of a cerebellar Purkinje
cell with active dendritic membrane was constructed. The model
was based on anatomic reconstructions of single Purkinje cells and
included 10 different types of voltage-dependent channels described
by Hodgkin-Huxley equations, derived from Purkinje cell specific
voltage-clamp data where available. These channels included
a fast and persistent Na$^+$ channel, three voltage-dependent
K$^+$ channels, T-type and P-type Ca$^{2+}$ channels, and two types of
Ca$^{2+}$ -activated K+ channels.
