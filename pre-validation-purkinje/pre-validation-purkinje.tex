\section*{Pre-validation of the Purkinje cell before model submission}

\subsection*{Introduction}

Model validation can be automated to a large extent.  This document
show specific capabilities of the GENESIS 3 publication system related
to automated model validation of single neuron models.  The neuron
model developed in~\cite{De-Schutter-E:1994vn},~\cite{E:1994hc} and
studied in~\cite{schutter94:_simul_purkin} is used as an example.

\subsection*{What is included?}

Automated validation of single neuron models includes the simulations
explained in the following sections.  Simulations for parameter
searches are not included.

\subsection*{Benchmarking}

\subsubsection*{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
\item Queries to the system for static model checks must be
  configured.  These checks complete 'instantly'.
\item For simple simulations benchmarking on a passive and an active
  version of the Purkinje cell has been done.  Details related to the
  stimulation protocol or simulation such as an active model with a
  passive soma or addition of a single synapse for unitary synaptic
  stimulation are ignored.
\item Simulation construction time for an active model is about 4
  seconds and for a passive model 0.5 seconds.  All simulations were
  run on a 2 CPU 8 core intel 64bit at 1.60GHz with 6MB level 2 cache.
  The simulations were neither run in parallel nor multi-threaded.
\item Estimates for more complicated analysis with results from many
  simulations such as figure~10 in~\cite{E:1994hc} are acquired by
  extrapolation of the estimates of the previous item.
\end{itemize}
