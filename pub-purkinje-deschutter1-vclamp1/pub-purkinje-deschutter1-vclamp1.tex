\section*{Fidelity of voltage clamps of Purkinje cells}

Constructing a realisticmodel of a neuron relies on the availability of high qualitydata, especially from voltage-clamp experiments. However,once constructed, the model itself can be used to explorethe likely value of the voltage-clamp experiments themselves.For example, using voltage-clamp techniques, Regehr\,\cite{Regehr:1992tg} have recently proposed that Na+ channelsare present in the (distal) dendrite as well as the soma of thePurkinje cell. They based this claim on the fact that they
could measure fast inward currents with whole-cell patchclamps of axotomized Purkinje cells under conditions ofgood voltage control in the soma. However, it has beensuggested that in these experiments the soma itself may nothave been adequately clamped\,\cite{Sugimori:1992hc}.
Using the model, we have found that the presence ofactive dendritic membrane had a dramatic effect on theelectrotonic length of the Purkinje cell and thus the abilityto achieve an adequate space clamp\,\cite{Rall:1985ys}.Passive membrane models predict that Purkinje cells areelectrotonically compact, with a length of $\approx$ 0.3\,X\,\cite{P:1985mb}. 
Rapp et al.\,\cite{Rapp-M:1992kx} have pointed out that the largesynaptic input the Purkinje cell receives could increase thislength by a factor of 2.4. Our model shows that during adendritic spike the electrotonic distance to the top of thedendrite increased by a factor of 3 compared with a passivemembrane dendrite. Between spikes the length was also increased,but less. Thus the state of activation of the dendriticchannels also made a significant difference in theelectrotonic length of the dendrite. Similarly, activation ofdendritic channels also caused a very bad space clamp, especiallyin the depolarizing direction. We have assumed thatthe application of Cs$^+$ externally and EGTA internallyblocked most K$^+$ currents completely\,\cite{Hille:1991zr}. If thiswas not the case, K$^+$ currents would contribute only a smallconductance compared with the CaP conductance and similarresults would be obtained.
Our results suggest that space clamp is extremely bad inadult Purkinje cells, with a significant divergence from theholding potential at only 50\,$\mu$m from the soma for depolarizingpotentials. Therefore it is possible that the Na$^+$currents recorded by Regehr et al.\,\cite{Regehr:1992tg} are carried byNa$^+$ channels located in the very proximal parts of themain dendrite. In our present model, we have confinedNa$^+$ channels to the soma, because several other studies,including TTX binding\,\cite{Llinas:1992rq}, dendriticpatch recordings (ibid.), and imaging with a fluorescentNa$^+$ indicator\,\cite{Lasser-Ross:1992ij} demonstratedNa$^+$ channels only on the soma and axon of thePurkinje cell.
Using the model, we can predict that space clamps couldbe somewhat improved if Ca$^{2+}$ channels were also blocked,but this was not the case in most reported whole-cell patchclampstudies\,\cite{Kaneda:1990ys, Llano:1991qf, Regan:1991ly, Regehr:1992tg}. 
Note that if the CaP channeldoes not inactivate, as has been reported by\,\cite{Usowicz:1992qf}, 
one cannot remove the Ca$^{2+}$ conductance bysteady depolarization as has been claimed in some studies\,\cite{Llano:1991qf}. 
In dissociated Purkinje cells, wherelarge parts of the dendritic tree may be amputated, spaceclamp can also assumed to be better. Thus the ``whole-cell''patch-clamp method may be appropriate to measure ioniccurrents in soma and proximal dendrite in dissociated, culturedPurkinje cells. Equations for several channels used inour model were based on this approach\,\cite{Hirano:1989uq, Kaneda:1990ys, Regan:1991ly}.

Finally, our ultimate objective in constructing this modelwas to explore synaptic influences on Purkinje cell firingpatterns.
