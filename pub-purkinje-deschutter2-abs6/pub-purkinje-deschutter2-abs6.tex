\subsection*{Abstract}

When climbing fiber input was given in the presence of
background asynchronous excitatory and inhibitory inputs the
shape of the complex spike in the soma was significantly affected.
However, the shape of the spike in the dendrites was almost constant.
This difference reflected the more variable excitability of the
soma compared with the dendrites.
