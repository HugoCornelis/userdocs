* ndf_save
** bugfixes in the model-container
*** virtual function call did not have correct number of arguments
*** spines attaching algorithm was not correctly updating meta information
** not that much progress

* developer package bugfixes

* updates to documentation
** consolidation of todos with information embedded in emails


- grant review?
- trip to London?
- other plans
  - CNS meeting?
- general status & progress
  - ndf_save
  - performance



* proposal review of symposium or something
** no idea what about...

* event in London
** Volker asked Jim to give a talk
** Christoph will be in London
*** Olfactory cortex model
** Simon will be there
*** Olfactory cortex model

* Hugo must sent email to D'Neece for prior approval

* CNS meeting
** abstract science
*** deadline Feb 16th
*** network model by Dave
*** G-2 abstract / G-3 poster?
** abstract G-3
*** 

* renewal update February / March

** ndf_save and benchmarks
** ndf_load does not set ranges properly for tables

* G-3 release
** 6 months from next CNS meeting
** limited resources
** Mando still working on python bindings
** Hugo working ndf_save

* current status and todo list
** sent to Damon
** not sent to anyone else
** should now send it to
*** Volker
*** Christoph
*** Simon

* mitral cell model
** voltage table offsets
** tab 2D channel

* steps necessary for Dave's model
** simple RSNet want python bindings
** 2nd population of cells
** connection probability radial distance
*** also new in G-2
**** pure sli_code
***** 3000 cells
***** 2 minutes simulation
***** 2.5 minutes model construction
**** compiled volumeconnect: 30 seconds model construction

* is G-3 ready for single cell modeling?
** it is ready but ... really incomplete

* zero G-2 tutorials run in G-3
** but we have analogs of some BoG tutorials
*** HH tutorial
*** squid tutorial ground work has been done
** G-3 functionality for nearly all of them exists

** python bindings are the stopper
*** Dave is going to find out with Mando
*** in the next 2-3 days

** Hugo should be in regular contact with
*** Simon, Christoph: mitral cell model, olfactory cortex model
*** Dave: auditory cortex model

** PC history review / book chapter
*** technology and science
*** still needs further work
