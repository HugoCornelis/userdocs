\section*{De Schutter: Purkinje Cell Model}

\subsection*{Abstract}

Both excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic channels were
added to the model to examine model responses to synaptic
inputs. Maximum synaptic conductance was the only parameter
that was tuned in these studies. Under these
conditions the model was capable of reproducing physiological
recorded responses to each of the major types of synaptic input.
