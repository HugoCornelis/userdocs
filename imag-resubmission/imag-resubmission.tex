\subsection*{Abstract}

\noindent This highly collaborative multi-scale modeling project interweaves a number of different scientific and technical objectives each of which, on their own, will advance their fields. Because the project is based in GENESIS, an existing and widely used modeling system, the effort will also provide a paradigm shifting technical capability for multi-scale modeling with application to a wide range of biological problems. The core premise of this project is that models, and especially those that reflect the actual structure of biological data, will increasingly become essential tools to organize experimental data, direct new experimental designs and eventually interpret the functional significance of the data generated. They will also become a mechanism for coordination and communication of scientific results and efforts. In this larger context, the core scientific objective of this project is to construct the first ever biologically realistic multi-scale model of the cerebellum from molecular to systems levels. The cerebellum is ideally suited for this kind of effort because the basic organization of its circuitry has been known for more than 100 years, and as a result most hypothesis regarding cerebellar function are linked to the structure's anatomy and physiology. In fact, this modeling effort will be organized to test and contrast two such hypotheses which represent very different views of the functional role of molecular layer synaptic plasticity in cerebellar function, a question that has been at the center of theoretical and experimental cerebellar investigations for more than 50 years. Once developed this model will also be used to establish the cerebellum as a model system to assess effects of aging and aging interventions on the central nervous system. To fulfill these ambitious objectives this project brings together a unique and diverse set of collaborators with both modeling and experimental experience at multiple different levels of scale as well as an advisory group of specialists in brain related aging research.

\subsection*{SPECIFIC AIMS}
\noindent The overall objective of this proposal is to accomplish four interrelated and mutually supporting specific aims:

\paragraph{Aim 1: Develop simulator capability to inter-link heterogeneous biologically realistic models across multiple levels of spatio-temporal scale within the new G-3 architecture.} One central design objective of the GENESIS system is to provide a common modeling platform to support the development of realistic biological models requiring different levels of scale. This has allowed GENESIS models to be built at all scales from molecular through large scale networks and systems. The original GENESIS architecture, however, did not readily support the necessary interaction amongst heterogeneous model components to efficiently connect them into a unified model and the incorporation of new components and simulator functionality was difficult and time consuming. Over the last several years, the core structure of the GENESIS simulator has been fundamentally redesigned to speed the process of adding new modeling capacity at different levels of scale.
%Additionally, the new software architecture of GENESIS explicitly supports interaction amongst heterogeneous model components.
Accordingly, the primary computational objective of this project is to develop the capacity to inter-link biologically realistic models across different spatio-temporal scales as opposed to simulation of independent models at their individual scales.

\paragraph{Aim 2: To construct a multi-scale model of cerebellar cortex to explore the functional significance of molecular layer synaptic plasticity.} The primary scientific objective of this project is to construct the first multi-scale biologically realistic model of cerebellar cortical networks, extending from molecular to system levels. The cerebellum is particularly well suited to this effort because its structural organization has been understood for more than 100 years and there is abundantly available experimental data on that structure. The specific focus of the effort will be on the functional role of molecular layer synaptic plasticity, which has been extensively studied since Marr and Albus independently proposed a novel parallel fiber synaptic modification mechanism in the late 1960s (Marr, 1969; Albus, 1971). The modeling effort will be organized around comparing and contrasting the original Marr/Albus hypothesis, which assumes that parallel fiber inputs directly affect the output spiking of Purkinje cells, with a more recent hypothesis that parallel fibers provide a modulatory function and do not directly drive Purkinje cell output (Bower, 2011). In the Marr/Abus formulation, the plastic properties of parallel fiber synapses determine which parallel fibers drive Purkinje cell output, while, in the alternative formulation, parallel fiber plasticity instead provides a general metabolic regulation of the relative strength of parallel fiber inputs with respect to molecular layer inhibition. Linking biological realistic simulations together across multiple levels of scale will allow us to formally test the implications of each hypothesis at different levels.

\paragraph{Aim 3: To apply the multi-scale modeling effort to quantify possible roles of the cerebellum in aging.} The P.I. has recently become a member of the Barshop Institute for Aging and Longevity Studies at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio. As a member of this Institute, he is charged with bringing modeling techniques, specifically with respect to the cerebellum to bear on aging studies. In fact, the cerebellum represents a unique structure with which to assess the neuronal effects of normal aging, as well as the neuronal consequences of aging interventions. The cerebellum undergoes greater volume atrophy and cell loss than any other known brain region and behaviors like motor performance, traditionally ascribed to the cerebellum are directly affected by aging. Further, specific cerebellar cellular mechanisms, like parallel fiber LTD, are known to also be affected by the normal aging process. While we recognize that linking experimentally measured changes in neuronal properties to behavioral measures is an ambitious task, the model to be developed here will begin the process of establishing a more solid foundation for such investigations.

\paragraph{Aim 4: Disseminate both the models developed and the tools for multi-scale modeling to the computational neuroscience community as a whole.} From the outset the GENESIS project has placed a significant emphasis on the development of supporting materials for the broader dissemination and use of models both as research and educational tools. Therefore, an important objective of this project is to introduce and support tools that will allow computational neuroscience access to multi-scale modeling technology.\\

\subsection*{RESEARCH STRATEGY}

\subsection*{A. Significance}

\noindent This highly collaborative multi-scale modeling project interweaves a number of different scientific and technical objectives each of which, on their own, will advance their fields. Because the project is based in GENESIS, this effort will also provide access to paradigm shifting technical tools for multi-scale modeling with anticipated application to a wide range of biological problems. Figure 1 illustrates graphically the partnership plan linking each of the participants in this project who represent a strong set of collaborators with diverse and overlapping expertise in both multi-scale modeling and experimental investigations.\\

\subsubsection*{A.1 Provide a new framework to organize and consider cerebellar experimental data.}

\noindent It is a core principle of the P.I.'s laboratory and of the laboratories of the collaborators, that models will increasingly become essential tools to organize experimental data, direct new experimental designs, and eventually interpret the functional significance of the data generated. Further, it is a core principle of our efforts that the models that are most useful in performing these functions will be those that are built in close relationship to the existing experimental data (Bower, 1992; Bower, 2005; Bower and Beeman, 2007). Accordingly, the overarching aim of this project is to develop a multi-scale model of cerebellar cortical circuitry based on a new set of multi-scale modeling tools to be constructed within the GENESIS simulation system (Bower and Beeman, 2007). Through the GENESIS system these new tools, as well as the model itself, will be fully accessible and provide the basis for ongoing dialog and collaboration. In fact, this collaboration came together because members of the team have already been engaged in such a scientific model-based dialog developed through the elaboration of an original Purkinje cell model which was one of the first `community models' in computational neuroscience (Bower 2011a). That model, which is also at the core of this project, was based on a passive Purkinje cell model published by Rapp, Segev, and Yarom almost 15 years ago (Rapp et al.,1994), to which, after importing the model into GENESIS, the P.I. together with his then postdoctoral fellow, Erik De Schutter introduced active conductances (De Schutter and Bower, 1994a;b;c). Since 1994, the elaboration of this single Purkinje cell model has been the stimulus for a series of ongoing studies within the Bower laboratory (Jaeger et al., 1997; Jaeger and Bower, 1999; Santamaria et al., 2002; 2007; Santamaria and Bower, 2005; Cornelis and Bower, 2007). It has also served as the basis for ongoing collaborations and studies in and between the laboratories of the P.I.s former students and postdocs (Steuber and De Schutter, 2001; Salinas et a., 2006, 2007; Steuber et al., 2007; Shin et al., 2007; De Schutter and Steuber, 2009: Coop et al., 2010; Anwar et al., 2010; Hendrickson et al., 2011a;b). Importantly, the same model has also been used by other laboratories not directly related to the Bower lab (Miyasho et al., 2001; Coop and Reeke, 2001; Chono et al., 2003; Traub et al., 2008; De Sousa et al., 2009; Luthman et al., 2011). Of significance to the current proposal, this model was also employed in the construction of a model at the network level of scale (Luthman et al., 2009; Maex \& Steuber, 2009; Santamaria et al., 2009). With this history as an existence proof, this new project will enhance the Purkinje cell model at the subcellular level and, through open access policies, test an improved model at the network level to produce the first genuinely multi-scale community model in computational neuroscience.\\

\subsubsection*{A.2 Specific scientific context: What is the role of molecular-layer synaptic plasticity in cerebellar function?}

\noindent It is also a core tenant of this collaborating team that even technical progress in science is best made when efforts are focused on a particular scientific question. In this case, the question of the role of molecular layer plasticity in cerebellar function has been at the forefront of discussions and debates regarding the cerebellum for almost half a century, since David Marr and Jim Albus independently speculated that changes in molecular layer synaptic strengths supported the function of the cerebellum as a pattern classifier that could learn to generate an appropriate output in response to arbitrary inputs (Marr 1969; Albus, 1971). Inspired by the contrast between the hundreds of thousands of synapses converging on each Purkinje cell from the mossy fiber$\rightarrow$granule cell pathway, and the climbing fiber pathway where each Purkinje cell (in the adult) is innervated by only one axon, it was specifically proposed that the strengths of parallel fiber synapses were changed by climbing fiber activation. When Masao Ito and his colleagues reported that parallel fibers underwent long term depression (LTD) in response to coincident climbing fiber activation (Ito et al., 1982), it set the stage for what has been a very large number of studies of cerebellar synaptic plasticity. In fact, a recent Pubmed search with the key words `cerebellum' and `plasticity' revealed more than 100 peer reviewed scientific papers published since the start of 2011 alone, with almost 75\% focused at the level of molecular mechanisms.

While the question of cerebellar plasticity has received a very large amount of experimental attention, it remains quite unclear what role plasticity plays in cerebellar function (contrast: De Zeeuw, 2011 with Vogt and Canepari, 2010 for example).

Accordingly, the central scientific objective of this effort will be to construct a multi-scale model to link experimental data at multiple levels of scale in order to quantitatively explore the possible roles of molecular layer plasticity in cerebellar function. To provide further focus to the project, we will initially use the model to contrast the original Marr/Albus proposal with a second, more recent hypothesis that proposes a very different functional role for parallel fiber synaptic plasticity. In the case of Marr/Albus and most other theories of the function of cerebellar cortex, it is assumed that parallel fiber activity is directly responsible for driving the output of the cerebellar Purkinje cell (Marr 1969; Albus 1971). In contrast, recent experimental and modeling work suggests that parallel fiber activity does not directly drive Purkinje cell output but instead is `modulatory' in nature (Jaeger and Bower 1999). Specifically it has been proposed that parallel fiber excitatation, working in concert with inhibitory inputs from molecular layer interneurons, generates a form of voltage clamp control over local regions of the Purkinje cell dendrite. This controlled voltage influences large calcium and related potassium conductances in the dendrites which, in turn, influence the firing of the Purkinje cell soma. Further details on this hypothesis can be obtained from a recently published review (Bower, 2011). However, the important point for the current project is that if this new hypothesis is correct, then activity dependent changes in molecular layer synapses may play a significant role in regulating the balance between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs rather than providing an explicit learning mechanism (De Schutter, 1995; De Schutter, 1997). As discussed in more detail below, another important point is that these two theories for the role of synaptic plasticity make very different functional predictions at multiple levels of scale.\\

\subsubsection*{A.3 The cerebellum as a model system for studying aging.}

\noindent While the question of the role of synaptic plasticity in cerebellar function is at the heart of many contemporary cerebellar theories (see Ito, 2006 for review), circumstances also provide an opportunity to explicitly link the question of cerebellar learning to a significant issue in human health: the role of the cerebellum in aging. Specifically in September of 2011, the P.I. joined the Barshop Institute for Longevity and Aging Studies at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio with two specific objectives: first to introduce computation approaches, including multi-scale modeling, to the institute; and second to further develop the cerebellum as a model system for studying the aging process and treatments that affect aging (such as caloric restriction and drugs like rapamycin). The multi-scale model to be constructed here will be central to both objectives. In fact, there are several clear links between the cerebellum and aging. First, it has been known for almost 100 years (Ellis 1919) that cerebellar volume is significantly reduced during aging and it is now known that the anterior lobe in humans can undergo up to a 15\% volume reduction by age 70 with a 45\% loss in the number of Purkinje cells (Andersen et al., 2003). This reduction in volume and cell number is larger than any so far reported for other mammalian brain structures. At the same time, functions traditionally associated with the cerebellum including balance, grip, and over all motor related behaviors are all affected in aging populations and associated with aging related diseases (for reviews see: Dominguez and Magro, 2009; Christou 2011; Vonsattel et al., 2011). Further, recent reports suggest aged mice are reduced in their performance of classical operant eye blink conditioning, a task some believe is also dependent on normal cerebellar function (Woodruff-Pak et al., 2010). Our own recent studies in normal humans and those with cerebellar deficits suggest that the cerebellum may influence the ability to detect pitch or localize sound in space (Petacchi et al., 2005; 2011; Parsons et al., 2009;), deficits also known to occur in aging populations (for review see Huang and Tang 2010).

While there would appear to be an explicit link between the cerebellum and behavior changes in aging, as with the cerebellar research as a whole, links between behavioral measures and actual biophysical and molecular aging effects remain largely circumstantial and correlational in the absence of a model integrating different levels of experimental scale. For example, in a study of eye blink conditioning in aging mice, the authors also report a reduced capacity for parallel fiber LTD (Woodruff-Pak et al., 2010). Is that correlation causal, or could reduced parallel fiber synaptic plasticity disrupt homeostatic regulation of synaptic input, resulting in premature death of Purkinje cells? Further, does the reduced performance of the mice in the eye blink conditioning task reflect a decreased capacity for cerebellar learning, or a decreased ability of the mice to detect the pitch associated with the conditioned stimulus (c.f. Parsons et al., 2009; Petacchi et al., 2005; 2011). While we recognize that any effort to link cellular to behavioral changes in aging or any behavioral measure is complex and difficult, ultimately we would claim that any such linkage is very likely to depend on the existence of a multi-scale model integrating observations at different levels of scale. In later sections, as a first step in that direction, we describe specific questions that will be asked of the model generated by this project.\\

\subsection*{B. Innovation}

\noindent At the heart of the innovation represented by this project is construction of the first ever biologically realistic multi-scale model in computational neuroscience. While some existing computational cerebellar models mix and match biological components at different levels of scale (for example, synaptic learning rules in large scale abstract systems models: c.f. Ohyama et al., 2010 and related models), this is the first effort to integrate fully detailed realistic models across multiple levels of scale. Accordingly, this project will embed models of biochemical and molecular mechanisms at the level of individual synapses (the work of collaborators Blackwell and Kubota) into models of Ca$^{2+}$ diffusion and buffering in spine heads (Blackwell, Santamaria, Kubota) and local regions of the dendrite (Kubota, Santamaria, Bower), models of synaptic and ion channel interactions at the cellular level (Santamaria, Bower and Jaeger), and link them to patterns of activity determined by network connectivity and patterns of afferent input (Bower, Jaeger and Steuber).\\

\subsubsection*{B.1 The GENERAL NEURAL SIMULATION SYSTEM (GENESIS)}

\noindent The\marginpar{here need both technical and CS framework} GENESIS
simulation system is at the core of the necessary computational innovation
of this project. As such this project extends the long history of
innovation in GENESIS (Bower and Beeman, 2006; 2007;
Beeman, 2011). For example, GENESIS provided the first graphical
modeling interface (Uhley et al., 1990; Bower and Hale 1991), the
first computational neuroscience website (1994), and also the first
use of virtual reality techniques for visualizing results (Leigh et
al., 1995). The GENESIS group also established the first standards to
judge the speed and reliability of neural simulators (Bhalla et al.,
1992), and the first tools to quantify parameter searches and modeling
results (Eichler-West, 1996; Baldi et al., 1998; Vanier and Bower,
1999). GENESIS was also one of the first computational modeling
systems to be run on parallel computers (Nelson et al., 1989; De
Schutter and Bower, 1992). Moreover, the GENESIS development group has
also been deeply involved in efforts to provide interoperability
between neural simulators (Beeman and Bower, 2004; Cannon, et al.,
2007), beginning with the Modelers Workspace project
(www.modelersworkspace.org) which drafted and promoted the first
markup language for realistic neural modeling (Goddard, et al., 2001).
These early efforts motivated the formation of the NeuroML project
(Crook, et al., 2007), which has subsequently fostered the development
of community modeling tools such as neuroConstruct (Gleeson, et. al.,
2007), both of which will be a core components of this project. The GENESIS
group also pioneered the use of modeling databases as sources of
biological data (Hucka, et al., 2002), spawning a major middleware
software project, now called The System's Biology Workbench (Hucka, et
al., 2001:http://www.sbw-sbml.org/), which has played an important
role in the development of multi-scale models in molecular and
cellular biology. GENESIS also served as the basis for the first set
of simulation-based tutorials for education in neuroscience through
the publication of The Book of GENESIS (Bower and Beeman, 1998) which
has so far been used for instruction in neuroscience and computational
neuroscience in more than 60 universities around the world (Beeman,
2011). %This project will add another stage of innovation to GENESIS.

  previous versions of GENESIS and other neuronal simulation
  platforms, the G-3 design is fundamentally modular, separating
  different functional components of the simulator into their own
  modules. Importantly, G-3 separates model descriptions (A) from the
  mathematical representations (B) used in actual model simulation. This
  simplifies the implementation of new solvers and other
  simulation time software components. The communication infrastructure
  connects different solvers simulating the same model and can
  `upscale' or `downscale' numerical data as needed. (Additional
  detail in Cornelis et al. 2011a;b).}

\subsubsection*{B.2 Multi-scale modeling.}

\noindent Of direct relevance to the innovation represented by this
grant, GENESIS was the first and remains the only simulation system
specifically designed \underline{from the outset} to support modeling
at multiple levels of biological scale (Bower and Beeman, 2006; 2007;
Brette et al., 2007). Reflecting this history, a recent survey of 324
peer-reviewed GENESIS publications (not involving the P.I. as an
author) revealing that 50\% involved network level models with most
describing large networks up to 10,000 neurons: 40\% were based on
models of single neurons; and 10\% were constructed to explore the
interaction of subcellular molecular components.  Firstly this project
will add to the computational tools already available for subcellular
level modeling (Bhalla and Iyengar, 1999; Bhalla, 2002; Sivakumaran,
et al., 2003) while also adding additional capacity to build large
scale network models.  More importantly this project will enhance
G-3's multi-scale modeling capabilities.

\subsubsection*{B.3 The new ``Scale-link'' functionality.}

\noindent Over the last 5 years with support from the National
Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) at NIH (R01
NS049288-05), the GENESIS development team has completely redesigned
and modernized the core structure of GENESIS to develop GENESIS
version 3.0 or G-3. These changes are briefly described in the
introduction of the ``Approach'' section of this proposal, however,
the important point with respect to innovation is that the structure
of G-3 provides a new and unique capacity for federated and modular
software development that supports multi-scale modeling. Furthermore,
the structure of G-3 also supports the direct real time interaction,
or embedding, of model components at different levels of scale.  As
described in more detail in subsequent sections, this is accomplished
through specific software modules that create intermediary
representations of variables present at multiple scales.

At present many neuroscience simulators, including G-2, allow
simulation at subcellular, cellular, or network scales, but are
restricted to each level of scale.  The monolithic nature of these
simulators makes it almost impossible to extend their functionalities
beyond the levels they explicitly support.  In contrast, the new
modular structure of G-3, particularly its ``model-container'' module
and novel ``communication infrastructure'' module, are key to the
extensibility of multi-scale simulation capabilities.  Firstly it
allows for rapid incorporation of new solvers responsible for specific
scales (see below for an example) and secondly, in compliance with the
G-3 software architecture and its facilitated extensibility,
scale-separation between solvers is maintained through the separation
of biological data from mathematical data and the provision of a
module that supports the implementation of different types of run-time
interfaces between any concurrently active solvers.
%the
%communication module allows implementation of different types of run-time
%interfaces between concurrent solvers, thereby effectively maintaining
%the scale-separation between these solvers, keeping them fundamentally
%compliant with the modular structure of G-3 and keeping them
%extensible to meet new user needs. 

At its essence, these new features of G-3 transform multi-scale
modeling in neuroscience from today's implementation of individual
models at specific levels to a systematic technique where the
integration of different independent solvers support model simulation
across multiple spatio-temporal scales.

Important to G-3's multi-scale capacity is the existence of a single
``model-container'' that stores a model across multiple spatial scales
during the model construction phase.  The ``model-container'' provides
an addressing algorithm that allows solvers to obtain the run-time
addresses of variables of other solvers independently of their scale
[see cbi-multiscale for details].  This functionality allows
instantiation of efficient communication components that can embed any
required numerical scheme or algorithm necessary for upscaling or
downscaling variables or other aspects of the integrated model.  It is
a feature that is essential to the implementation of scale-linking in
G-3.

A first use case of the addressing algorithm the Discrete Event System
(DES) is a G-3 software component that specifically supports large
scale network modeling.  For run-time performance it stores action
potentials as simple discrete events that are delivered to
post-synaptic target sites at the appropriate times. It translates
between the discrete event domain and continuous time and provides an
interface between mathematical solvers and event queues, across
different model scales.
%, that links simulation objects running at their
%own specific scale.
As described in the next section, the most innovative and challenging
computational aspect of this project involve implementation of the
tools to expand the communication module to support cross-linking and
embedding finer scale simulation in cellular and network level models.

Traditional multi-scale techniques such as 
%multi-grid method, fast
%multi-pole method,
domain decomposition, adaptive mesh refinement methods, and wavelet
based methods, capture the macroscale behaviour of a system by the
simulation of details of microscale models.  They are supported by the
'Solvers' module in the G-3 architecture.  Recent multi-scale
techniques include the quasi-continuum method, heterogeneous
multi-scale modeling and adaptive model refinement (reviewed in Weinan
et al., 2007).  They capture system behaviour by directly coupling
macroscale and microscale model components.  This grant includes
specific support for the incorporation of such techniques into G-3 as
part of the 'Communication Infrastructure' module.

%Importantly, because of its modular structure, G-3 allows in principle
%the incorporation of both traditional multi-scale techniques and more recent multi-scale techniques the distinction
%between these two approaches is that traditional multi-scale
%methods capture the macroscale behaviour of a system by simulation of details
%of microscale models, while the more recent methods capture system
%behaviour by directly coupling macroscale and microscale model components.

%such as the:
%multi-grid method, fast multi-pole method, domain decomposition and
%adaptive mesh refinement methods, and wavelet based methods; and more recent
%multi-scale techniques such as the quasi-continuum method, and heterogeneous
%multi-scale modeling and adaptive model refinement (reviewed in Weinan et al., 2007).  This
%distinction allows specialized solvers to be independently incorporated as different components in the solver module of the G-3 simulator
%architecture\marginpar{needs improvement}.

It is important to note that while the structure
of G-3 supports this kind of functionality, at present there is only support for expansion
  of the scope of the biological layer (Fig.\,\ref{fig:cbi-architecture-expanded}A) as the current NIH grant is
focused on reorganizing and modernizing the simulator, and on
user support, tutorial generation, and the necessary extensive
documentation of the new system. There is neither direct
support for expansion of the scope
  of the mathematical layer (Fig.\,\ref{fig:cbi-architecture-expanded}B) nor the associated development required for support of
multi-scale modeling. Of course, the NINDS grant also does
not support the specific scientific objective of constructing a
multi-scale cerebellar model.  Accordingly, although synergistic,
there is no overlap between these two projects. This new proposal,
however, will add a capability to G-3 anticipated to considerably expand
its value to the computational neuroscience community.\\

\subsection*{C. Approach}

\subsubsection*{C.1 GENESIS as the basis for our approach.}

\noindent Before considering our approach to each of the Specific Aims
of this project, initially the way in which
G-3 specifically supports this multi-scale modeling effort is described. As
given in more detail in Cornelis et al.\,(2011a; b) a key
component of G-3, also central to its use in multi-scale
modeling, is a redesign around two workflows, one for the user and the
other for developers. The user workflow makes explicit the
linkage between modeling and experimental results with support, for
example, of experimental protocols like RTXI (Cornelis and Coop,
2010).  Because streamlining the
process of adapting and extending GENESIS was also a key objective of
the redesign, the modular structure of G-3 now supports not only the
independence but also the interoperability of different software
components of the overall system. Of direct relevance to the current
project, these changes: (1) reduce software module complexity 
when compared to more traditional monolithic systems (prior versions
of GENESIS and NEURON for example), (2) simplify module documentation
 in terms of inputs and outputs, (3) more easily incorporate
new simulation modules (Chemsis and CDS for example, see below),
and (4) simplify module development and testing as stand-alone
components. Overall, as organized by the developer workflow, the effect is to provide a much clearer
delineation of the scope of new module development\marginpar{unclear
  how the workflows do this, explain the workflows as complementary to
  the CBI architecture}, including the addition of simulator functionality operating
at different levels of model scale.  The G-3 architecture is also
`federated' as it extends the modular approach associated with the
development of single applications to the functional integration of
otherwise independent applications. In doing so it provides a single
collaboration framework for modeling and software development. As
described in the next section these changes have already allowed
new molecular scale modeling capacity to be rapidly incorporated into the
overall system.\\ %They will be essential to add additional modeling
%capacity at other levels of scale, as well as the software components
%necessary for models at different levels of scale to interact.

\subsubsection*{C.2 Specific Aim 1: Develop simulator capability to inter-link heterogeneous biologically realistic models across multiple levels of spatio-temporal scale within the new G-3 architecture.}

\noindent Having described the new features of G-3 that make this
project possible, here we describe our specific
approach to adding the capacity to construct detailed subcellular
molecular/biochemical, and biophysical models, as well as large scale
network of systems level models\marginpar{communication framework
  description, embed in computer science background}. Given
space limitations, the G-3 implementation of
single compartmental neurons or small-scale neuronal networks are not described in detail here (for extensive descriptions, see Bower and Beeman 2006; 2007). Additionally, in this section
we briefly describe the computational approach to linking simulation across
different levels of scale.  With respect to time lines and outcomes,
development of the computational capability to support these different scales 
and their interaction will be continuous over the
entire 5 years of the grant and will be coordinated by the Bower
laboratory in partnership with the other collaborators. Individual
time lines and expected outcomes will be described in section C.3 for
specific components of the multi-scale cerebellar model to be
used as a test case for all software implementation.

\paragraph{C.2.1. Sub-cellular level modeling.} Key to the success of this project is the expansion of tools for constructing sub-cellular level models. Accordingly, as a test of the new multi-scale modeling capacity of G-3 we began working in May of 2011 with Dr. Avrama Blackwell (now a collaborator on this grant) to incorporate the core functionality of ``Chemesis'' (Blackwell 2000, Blackwell and Kotleski 2002) into G-3. Chemesis supports the modeling of biochemical reactions, second messengers, and calcium dynamics (Blackwell, 2000). It was originally added on to GENESIS version 2.0 by adding a user-contributed library over multiple years. In contrast, the core features of ``Chemesis-3'' were added to G-3 in under 3 months. It now runs almost three times faster than in GENESIS-2. Several explicit features of G-3 enabled rapid and successful integration, including: 1) modular separation of new solver development from that of other software components, allowing full focus on the mathematical aspects of the solver and their implementation, and better optimization; 2) facilitated integration, via the G-3 Developer package, of the Chemesis-3 solver into the build system of G-3, which also enabled immediate regression tests; 3) easy extension of model-container configuration to establish new declarative model tokens and parameters recognized by pre-existing Chemesis-3 solvers; 4) easy construction of an interface between the model-container application programmers interface (API) and the core of the Chemesis-3 solver, and finally 5) specific development of a software module that interfaced the new solver with the pre-existing linear cable solver. In addition to the further development of Chemesis-3, the same G-3 developer functionality can be used to add a biochemical kinetic modeling system being developed for MOOSE (Bhalla and Iyengar, 1999; Bhalla, 2002; Sivakumaran, et al., 2003; Ray and Bhala, 2008).

With\marginpar{link with computer science} respect to the
scientific objective of this project and thus Specific Aim 2, these
new sub-cellular modeling capabilities will allow us to model pre- and
postsynaptic molecular mechanisms involved in synaptic plasticity.
Further, because each of these sub-cellular modeling components are an
integrated part of a single model-container (see Cornelis 2011a),
existing and new G-3 solvers can be linked to simulate
different aspects of the same model. This ``scale-linking''
functionality of G-3 instantiates dedicated run-time software
components that contain intermediary representations of solved
variables that can pass both ``upscale'' and ``downscale'' values to
simulations at different levels of scale.  Technically, in the case of
Chemesis-3 and the linear cable solver, for example, these modules
calculate weighted space-time averages.

\paragraph{C.2.2 Biophysical models of calcium diffusion and buffering.} In support and in relationship to the new molecular kinetic modeling features that will be added to G-3, this project will also work to incorporate two types of 3-D Monte Carlo-based techniques for modeling reaction/diffusion kinetics. Specifically, Dr. Avrama Blackwell will work with the G-3 development team to implement NeuroRD (Oliveira et al., 2010), a computationally efficient approximate Monte Carlo approach to modeling reaction-diffusion systems. In addition, the G-3 development team will work with Dr. Yoshi Kubota to incorporate CDS (Cellular Dynamics Simulator: http://nba.uth.tmc.edu/cds/) a precise particle-based Monte Carlo simulator specifically supporting the modeling of Ca$^{2+}$ binding and diffusion dynamics within biochemical networks (Byrne et al. 2010; Kubota and Waxham 2011). CDS is based on the event-driven first passage time algorithm (Byrne et al. 2010) and is designed to serve as a flexible platform for multi-scale hybrid algorithms. For this reason, the CDS algorithm can be directly combined with any deterministic ODE/PDE (Reaction-Diffusion Equation) solvers (e.g., V-Cell used in Hernjak et al. 2005) including those already included in G-3. High-resolution cellular morphology including that of dendritic spines can be directly transported to CDS allowing electro-diffusion to be simulated by both deterministic (as in Lopreore et al. 2008) as well as particle-based 3-D stochastic methods. The CDS research team will work closely with NeuroRD and G-3 developing team to establish a series of hybrid algorithms applicable to several different model scales. This will allow us to compare different simulation algorithms for Ca$^{2+}$ binding diffusion, voltage clamp, and biochemical network within the same platform and will help derive and validate simplified macroscopic (biochemical) synaptic rules relevant to the objectives of Specific Aim 2.

From a technical point of view, the incorporation of
simulations modules that specifically involve spatial dimensions is,
in principle, much more difficult than the integration of biochemical
kinetic models. In fact the accurate representation of space and time
for multi-scale simulations is an open research area and will be one
of the core technical challenges in this project. However, the
explicit provision of software modules for the intermediary
representation of solved variables will allow us to compare and
evaluate different methods of scale-linking, for instance by comparing
different resolutions of a fixed grid with adaptive grid intermediary
representations (Bernabeul et al., 2009). In effect, this will allow
us to use multi-scale G-3 models as a framework to compare different
technical strategies\marginpar{single change in a configuration file

  software components, producing alternative performance and other
  results of the same simulated model}.

\paragraph{C.2.3 Single compartmental neuronal models.} Since GENESIS was first launched it has been used extensively to construct compartmental models at the single cell level. This project, in fact, is based on a Purkinje cell model which has been extensively tested and used in multiple laboratories over the last 20 years (De Schutter and Bower, 1994a;b;c; Jaeger et al., 1997; Jaeger and Bower, 1999; Steuber and De Schutter, 2001; Miyasho et al., 2001; Coop and Reeke, 2001; Santamaria et al., 2002; 2007; Chono et al., 2003; Santamaria and Bower, 2005; Cornelis and Bower, 2007; Maux and Deschutter, 2007; Steuber et al., 2007; Shin et al., 2007; Traub et al., 2008; De Sousa et al., 2009; De Schutter and Steuber, 2009: Luthman et al., 2009; 2011; Maex \& Steuber, 2009; Santamaria et al., 2009; Coop et al., 2010; Anwar et al., 2010; Hendrickson et al., 2011a;b). This model, like most compartmental models, is based on the actual anatomical geometry of a mammalian Purkinje cell (Rapp et al., 1994) to which have been added the major synaptic and voltage related conductances in the form of equivalent circuit representations of Hodgkin-Huxley dynamics (Santamaria and Bower, 2008). As part of this project, and as described below, the conductances in this model will be updated and enhanced with newly available experimental data.

\paragraph{C.2.4 Large--scale network level modeling.} As already described GENESIS has been used since the outset to build network level models of neuronal circuits. In fact, the original structure of GENESIS itself was based on a network simulation of olfactory cortex (Beeman, 2011). As part of this project, we will expand the computational capability of G-3 to support the construction of very large scale network and system models based on more abstracted neuronal components. In support of this function, the G-3 model-container applies specific algorithms to instantiate systems level connectivity models and convert them to mathematical representations, relieving the mathematical solvers from the pressure typical for rich heterogeneous model structures. At the same time, the intermediate simulation system modules already described as the mechanism used to link Chemesis-3 and the linear cable solver, will also be used to share values and functions between larger scale network simulations and lower scale models. The long term (Nelson et al., 1989; De Schutter and Bower, 1992) and intrinsic support for use of parallel computing resources within the GENESIS system will also be critical to the ability to run these large scale models (Cornelis 2011a; b) with the simulations performed on Linux clusters of 100-500 CPU cores. \\

\subsubsection*{C.3 Specific Aim 2A: Constructing a multi-scale model of cerebellar cortex to explore the functional significance of molecular layer synaptic plasticity}

\noindent For the sake of overall clarity, we have chosen to divide our approach to Specific Aim 2 into the implementation of the multi-scale cerebellar model, and then the specific use of the model to test conflicting hypothesis regarding the role of synaptic plasticity in cerebellar function. Each specific objective described here is followed by both an expected time line as well as the specific partnership plan associated with the implementation of individual model components.

\paragraph{C.3.1 Biophysical modeling of single compartments of the Purkinje cell dendrite.} One can argue that all computational properties of neurons are determined by electrochemical interactions at sub-cellular levels. Therefore, the development of models of synaptic plasticity, for example, first depend on the construction of a biophysically accurate model of small regions of the Purkinje cell dendrite (Cornelis, 2007). To do so we will use recently obtained serial electronmicroscopic reconstructions of 5--10\,$\mu$m lengths of Purkinje cell dendrite which include the explicit locations of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs (Lu et al, 2009). These data include complete reconstructions of the locations and shapes of dendritic spines on 40 segments. As expected, parallel fiber (granule cell) synapses are located on the spines while inhibitory inputs from molecular layer interneurons are located directly on the dendritic shafts. Once these segments are represented in G-3, we will include Ca$^{2+}$ diffusion and buffering mechanisms using the newly incorporated CDS components. Using the model we will be able to study the effects of synaptic activity and dendritic structure on Ca$^{2+}$ diffusion and buffering mechanisms. Importantly, using the multi-scale modeling capabilities of G-3, during simulation each of these high-resolution segments of the dendrite will be embedded in a larger full Purkinje cell compartmental model. In this way, local changes in Ca$^{2+}$ concentration and voltage will be influenced by and in turn influence neighboring compartments. Based on our previous experimental and computational work (Santamaria et al., 2006, 2011) we would predict little effect of dendritic structure on the diffusion rates of Ca$^{2+}$; however, anomalous diffusion of buffers could arise in longer time windows (Santamaria, 2011).

The expected timeline for construction of this model is one year and will be carried out as a collaboration between the Bower, Santamaria, and Kubota groups. The model, once constructed, will be tested against confocal calcium diffusion data available from Santamaria (Santamaria,et al., 2006).

\paragraph{C.3.2 Modeling the detailed biochemical networks underlying multiple forms of plasticity.} Having established a high resolution dendritic segment model within the larger Purkinje cell multi-compartmental model, we will next further extend the resolution of the overall multi-scale model by including pre- and post synaptic molecular mechanisms using Chemesis tools and either NeuroRD (Oliveira et al., 2010) or CDS depending on the requirements of the simulation. The goal of this study is to better understand how molecular level pathway changes remain localized to single spines or spread to neighboring areas in a detailed Purkinje cell dendritic morphology reconstructed from EM data (Santamaria et al., 2006). Understanding the spatial spread of specific pathway interactions is important to determine the presence or absence of synaptic specificity of synaptic plasticity rules based on distinct biochemical pathway interactions. Specifically, we will implement LTD associated signaling pathways activated by metabotropic glutamate receptors (Kotaleski et al. 2002) that lead to calcium release and activation of protein kinase C (Ito et al., 1982), as well as the NO$\rightarrow$PKG pathways, known to be involved in non-specific LTD (Wang et al., 2000; Reynolds \&Hartell, 2000; Hartell, 1996). We also will model molecules of the PI3 kinase/AKT/mTOR pathway, which are activated by tyrosine kinase receptors, and are involved in aging related changes (see below). All of these signaling pathways are localized to the post-synaptic sites of the Purkinje cell. These detailed components will be embedded in the high-resolution membrane component--itself embedded in the multi-compartmental Purkinje cell model as just described. In this way, the postsynaptic molecular mechanisms simulated using NeuroRD and/or Chemesis will be influenced by the calcium diffusion and buffering dynamics simulated by the CDS tools at the level of small segments of the Purkinje cell dendrite, themselves then influenced by equivalent circuit simulation at the compartmental level. As opposed to the case of exclusively simulating buffered Ca$^{2+}$ we expect that dendritic structure will have strong effects on the diffusion of other molecules involved in LTD, such as IP3, PKC, and CamK. Such effects, will also likely contribute to the specificity of the second messengers around the activated synapse.

The expected timeline of implementation of the basic biochemical model components will be over the first 3 years with the first two initially focused on implementing the different types of synaptic plasticity seen in the parallel fiber synapse. This effort will be the primary responsibility of the Blackwell, Santamaria, and Kubota groups. The expected outcome is the replication of the well described dependence of synaptic plasticity on postsynaptic depolarization. The model will also be tested against the various temporal patterns of parallel fiber and climbing fiber activations used in the literature that result in synaptic modification (Steuber, 2007).

\paragraph{C.3.3 Compartmental Purkinje cell model.} While the single Purkinje cell model has previously been extensively studied (De Schutter and Bower, 1994a;b;c; Jaeger et al., 1997; Jaeger and Bower, 1999; Steuber and De Schutter, 2001; Miyasho et al., 2001; Coop and Reeke, 2001; Santamaria et al., 2002; 2007; Chono et al., 2003; Santamaria and Bower, 2005; Cornelis and Bower, 2007; Maux and Deschutter, 2007; Steuber et al., 2007; Shin et al., 2007; Traub et al., 2008; De Sousa et al., 2009; De Schutter and Steuber, 2009: Luthman et al., 2009; 2011; Maex \& Steuber, 2009; Santamaria et al., 2009; Coop et al., 2010; Anwar et al., 2010; Hendrickson et al., 2011a;b) it will be significantly enhanced and upgraded as part of this project. In particular, since originally published (De Schutter and Bower, 1994a;b;c) additional information has become available regarding both the kinetics of channels already included in the model, such as voltage-gated currents (Raman and Bean, 2001; Sacco and Tempia, 2002; Williams et al., 2002; Martina et al., 2003; Martina et al., 2007) and calcium gated potassium currents (Womack and Khodakhah, 2002b, 2003; Womack et al., 2004). Additionally, new information is available on slow currents that have not yet been included in the model (Genet and Kado, 1997; Bushell et al., 2002; Genet and Delord, 2002; Womack and Khodakhah, 2002a). The update and addition of these conductances will allow experimental manipulations of the model to more closely parallel biological measurements and dynamics. Further, because this model will serve as the context for subcellular level modeling, such additions will likely also have effects on sub-cellular processes, perhaps especially the introduction of the longer time course currents. These may be particularly important in studying the effects of aging.

We expect that these enhancements and extensions of the
Purkinje cell model to occur during the first year of the grant
and will be the responsibility of the Bower, Santamaria and Jaeger
groups. As with the original Purkinje cell model (De Schutter,
1994a), the enhanced model is expected to replicate voltage and
current clamp experimental data, and also respond appropriately to the
use of specific channel blockers. An important part of this project
will also be confirmation of the previously published behavior of the model
following its enhancement. While space does not allow a detailed
description, to track model evolution G-3 has specific provisions (in the form of regression tests to compare
signals and a project browser to visually compare simulation
results) for comparison of updated models
to previous behavior.

\paragraph{C.3.4 Network level modeling, realistic patterns of pre-synaptic input.} Once the high resolution molecular and cellular level models have been implemented, the next important model-addressable set of parameters involves the actual biologically expected temporal and spatial patterns of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic input converging on the Purkinje cell dendrite. To simulate these more global patterns of activity, we will construct an exponential integrate-and-fire Purkinje cell model with additional conductance based currents. This more simplified model will be tuned to accurately reproduce the dynamics of the original Purkinje cell model, which itself reflects the dynamics of actual Purkinje cells with considerable precision (De Schutter and Bower, 19941; b; Fourcaud-Trocme et al., 2003; Richardson 2009). Parameters for this type of model can be adjusted to match the spiking dynamics of different cerebellar cell types and it will be used to construct a network with physiological ratios of and connectivity between cerebellar cortical cell types. Due to the simplicity of these cells, in this more abstracted network model, parameters such as axonal delays and synaptic strengths as well as the population characteristics of activated mossy fiber inputs can be adjusted using optimization techniques such as evolutionary searches (Vanier and Bower, 1999; Hendrickson, et al. 2011a) operating over several thousand cellular elements. The objective function for these searches will be a replication of spontaneous firing activity as well as the experimental data of sensory responses in individual neurons.

Once all components of this new large scale network model have been linked, the model will be tuned to specifically replicate cerebellar sensory responses to lip stimulation (Bower, 2011b), which have been widely employed experimentally to characterize in vivo activity of different cerebellar cortical elements including climbing fibers (Brown and Bower, 2002; Schultz et al., 2009) mossy fibers (Rancz et al., 2007), granule cells (Bower and Kassel, 1990; Morissette and Bower 1996; Hartmann and Bower, 2001), Purkinje cells (Bower and Woolston 1983; Jaeger and Bower 1994), Golgi cells {Vos et al., 1999) and inhibitory interneurons (Chu et al., 2011), as well as neurons in the cerebellar nuclei receiving output from cerebellar cortex (Rowland and Jaeger, 2005). These types of tactile inputs have also been used to simultaneously define the relationships between activity in different cerebellar neurons and structures (Bower and Woolston, 1983; Jaeger and Bower, 1994; Brown and Bower, 2001; Lu et al., 2005). Therefore, the baseline and stimulus-elicited activity found in these studies provides a solid target for all major types of neurons in a system level simulation. As a further test of realistic network function, subsets of the Purkinje cell population output will be connected as established in previous studies (Lin and Jaeger, 2011) to a single simulated deep cerebellar nucleus neuron (DCN) simplified to consist only of about 10 compartments (Hendrickson et al., 2011). This DCN model will also receive collateral drive from the mossy fiber inputs that stimulate the cerebellar cortical network model. As is expected from evolutionary optimization searches, many solutions of network parameters that lead to realistic single cell characteristics will be found, and these will be further pruned by the additional constraint that a population of Purkinje cell outputs can drive the DCN model activity to match experimental recordings.

In the final stage of construction of the cerebellar model, more abstracted network simulation will be instrumented with more detailed representations of neuronal behavior at the other levels of scale. To do so, a small number of individual exponential-integrate and fire Purkinje cells within the network will be replaced with the full compartmental Purkinje cell model already described in which the sub-cellular components have been embedded (see above). In this way the more detailed Purkinje cell model will be able to test and influence more `macroscopic' synaptic plasticity rules implemented in the full network model. As described in the next section of this proposal, this assembled multi-scale model will be used to test several specific predictions and functional speculations.

The expected timeline for initial network model construction is two years (years one and two of the funding period) with full integration with the other levels of modeling occurring over the following three years (years 3--5 of the grant). The initial network construction of simplified neuron models and their match to recorded network activity will be carried out by the Jaeger group with support from the Crook group, based on their explicit experience constructing simplified but realistic neurons (Crook et al., 1998a;b). Incorporating synaptic plasticity rules in the Purkinje cell model will be carried out by the Steuber group. Adding the scale of biochemical pathway modeling will be jointly carried out in the Blackwell, Kubota, and Santamaria groups. All computational aspects will be implemented by the Bower and Crook laboratories. Testing of the full multi-scale model will involve a step wise bottom-up approach testing individual simulation results, matching them to empirical data. This will cover the full scope of the model by collaboration between all groups, as will testing of the specific hypothesis described in the next section.\\

\subsubsection*{C.4. Specific Aim 2B: Testing competing hypotheses regarding the function of cerebellar cortical LTD.}

\noindent The longest standing
hypothesis regarding the functional significance of synaptic
plasticity in the cerebellar cortex is that climbing fiber input acts
as a `teacher' for synapse-specific LTD on parallel fibers, weakening
those synapses that are co-active with that input (Marr,
1969; Albus, 1971). In more abstract theoretical models (e.g.  Ohyama
et al., 2010) this form of plasticity drives behaviorally relevant
modification of Purkinje cell activity by reducing the drive on
neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei and activating specific motor
behaviors. While some experimental work would seem to confirm that
climbing fiber inputs lead to a weakening of temporally associated
parallel fiber synapses (Ito, 1982; 1989; Wang, et al.. 2000), these
results remain controversial. For example, those studies typically used
restricted input patterns such as parallel fiber beam stimulation and
thus do not exclude other forms of input activity that may also elicit
parallel fiber plasticity. The multi-scale network model of a
cerebellar cortical module is ideally suited to address this
complexity, as the consequences of natural patterns of network
activity and its influence on dendritic voltage dynamics in the
realistic Purkinje cell inset of the network can be iterated through
multiple plasticity scenarios. As an initial test and target for the
model, we will specifically test questions
raised by two conflicting views of the role of parallel
fiber LTD in the cerebellum: one assumes LTD is associated with
synaptic learning (Marr 1969, Albus 1971, Ohyama et al., 2010); the other that LTD reflects a more metabolic regulation of the total
amount of parallel fiber synaptic input converged at Purkinje cell
dendrites (De Schutter 1995; Bower 2011). While it is most likely that
these simulations will generate even more complex questions, for
focus we will initially address the following:

\paragraph{C.4.1 Can molecular layer inhibition maintain membrane voltage control given parallel fiber activation?} A core prediction of the homeostatic model of parallel fiber function is that excitatory parallel fiber input, in combination with feedforward molecular layer inhibition, provides a voltage clamp-like control over local regions of the Purkinje cell dendrite. Using the high-resolution model of small sections of the Purkinje cell dendrite, we can specifically test the ability of a single inhibitory synapse to maintain control over the dendritic membrane voltage as different numbers of parallel fiber synapses are activated in this dendritic region. Each of the unique geometries (dendritic widths for example) of each of the 40 available reconstructed dendritic segments will be explored.

\paragraph{C.4.2 Does parallel fiber input, under natural stimulation conditions, produce a level of postsynaptic depolarization capable of triggering LTD?} One of the original inspirations for the Marr/Albus hypothesis was that the single climbing fiber input to each cerebellar Purkinje cell produces an enormous postsynaptic Ca$^{2+}$ spike and membrane depolarization (refs). It has been shown in vitro, however, that LTD can be induced by sufficient levels of parallel fiber depolarization without the presence of a climbing fiber input (Hartell, 1996).

Typically these in vitro studies are undertaken in the presence of inhibitory blockers and use artificial stimulation protocols such as regular 1\,Hz stimulation of parallel fibers  (Hartell, 1996). We therefore propose to use the network level model to assess whether, under realistic network conditions and especially in the presence of feed forward inhibition, parallel fiber inputs could produce the levels of depolarization necessary to induce parallel fiber LTD. While primarily a network level model, the behavior of the model will depend on parameters for the local interaction between inhibition and excitation obtained at the subcellular scale.

\paragraph{C.4.3 Can non-specific LTD still be an effective mechanism for pattern learning in Purkinje cells?} Since the original discovery of parallel fiber LTD (Ito et al., 1982), the experimentally described mechanisms for molecular layer synaptic plasticity have become increasingly complex and nuanced. For example, recent evidence suggests that at least some forms of parallel fiber LTD are not restricted only to active parallel fibers but may spread to nearby inactive parallel fiber synapses as well (Wang et al., 2000; Reynolds \& Hartell, 2000; Hartell, 1996), although it is not yet clear to what extent this non-specific LTD occurs in vivo. With respect to testing the two hypothesis of parallel fiber function, incorporating the multi-scale Purkinje cell model into the network model will allow us to test the consequences for non-specific LTD on possible parallel fiber learning mechanisms. This is an extension of preliminary work by the Steuber team, which suggests that cerebellar learning breaks down when the spread of non-specific LTD extends more than a few micrometers from active parallel fiber synapses (Safaryan et al., 2011; Safaryan et al., 2010). By incorporating a detailed model of NO diffusion and related biochemistry at the level of parallel fiber projections onto Purkinje cells, we can predict how many inactive parallel fibers could, in principle, be affected by realistic network levels of activity. Further this multi-scale model will allow us to examine the possible effect of molecular layer inhibition on this mechanism. It should also be noted that, at present, in the absence of any predicted realistic patterns of parallel fiber activity, all LTD/LTP induction protocols in cerebellar slices likely use unrealistic protocols such as five minutes of regular 1\,Hz stimulation of a bundle of parallel fibers  (for example Steuber et al., 2007). Typically, in vitro protocols also block cortical inhibition (Steuber et al., 2007).

\paragraph{C.4.4 Is non-specific LTD more likely to be an effective mechanism to ``metabolically'' regulate the overall levels of parallel fiber excitation with respect to molecular layer inhibition?} As an alternative to the hypothesis that LTD, including non-specific LTD, implements a network learning mechanism, we will use the detailed local dendritic model to test whether the known properties of non-specific LTD in particular could serve as a mechanism to control the overall strength of parallel fiber inputs, thus regulating local excitability of the Purkinje cell dendrite. We can use the same model to determine whether the LTD and LTP reported for molecular layer inhibitory synapses (Mittmann \& Hausser, 2007; Kano et al., 1992) might also contribute to such a regulatory mechanism. Linkage between sub-cellular level components and network level simulation that predicts natural patterns of activity in parallel fibers and molecular layer interneurons will also help constrain model parameters.

The timeline of studies addressing these specific questions on the functional role of LTD in the cerebellum depends on the implementation of the underlying models. Some questions can be asked in an initial form with single scale models, with the results eventually tested using the fully integrated multi-scale model. Others, however, will need to wait for that full-scale model. Accordingly, it is difficult to predict in which year of the grant each question can be fully addressed. We anticipate, however, that serious testing will likely begin in year two continuing through the length of the grant. All of these studies will occur in a feedback cycle between molecular pathway models that are continuously improved during this period and multi-scale modeling that tests molecular level pathways within a framework of realistic network activity patterns. The work will involve all groups collaborating on the project.\\

\subsubsection*{C.5 Specific Aim 3: Significance for aging research.}

\noindent We believe that our multi-scale cerebellar model, once constructed and tested, also has considerable potential significance in providing a basis to link cerebellar related molecular and cellular changes to behavior. This effort will be explicitly applied to the relationship between the cerebellum and aging in consultation with our advisory group at the Barshop Institute for Longevity and Aging Studies of which the P.I. is now a member. Given space limitations, here we provide only three specific examples of possible aging related questions to be addressed with the model:

\paragraph{C.5.1 How are the mTOR-rapamycin and Ca$^{2+}$-signaling cascades implicated in aging related to changes in parallel fiber synaptic plasticity?} Given current interest in the relationship between the mechanisms of apoptosis and aging, particularly in the mTOR-rapamycin cascade (Garelick and Kennedy, 2011; Mashimo et al., 2009), there is growing interest in the link between Ca$^{2+}$-binding proteins (and related proteins) with aging. For example, the knockout of Ca$^{2+}$ binding proteins (e.g. calbindin and calretinin) in a Purkinje cell results in a movement disorder which in turn appears age-dependent (Schwaller et al. 2002). One specific focus of considerable research in this regard is on PEP19 (also called PCP4) (Wei et al. 2011). This calmodulin binding protein is expressed in Purkinje cells (and basal ganglia) and appears to be strongly related to the sensitivity of these neurons to Alzheimer's and Huntington's diseases (as well as other neurodegenerative disorders). A recent genetic knockout analysis strongly suggested PEP19 may also be the key regulator of synaptic plasticity in Purkinje cells (Wei et al. 2011). While all this work speculates on the relationship between molecular layer changes and overall effects in the cerebellum, we are unaware of any current modeling efforts that attempt to explicitly link these levels of scale. This work will be undertaken by the Kubota group, with support from the Blackwell and Santamaria groups, during years 3--4 of the grant. The group has established a kinetic framework to model PEP19-like proteins (Kubota et al. 2008; Putkey et al. 2008) and will implement the model component of Ca$^{2+}$-binding proteins expressed in cerebellum based on known experimental data (Hartmann and Konnerth 2005; Schwaller 2009) (C2.2 and 3.1). Together with the mTOR cascade model (C3.2), these kinetic models will be used here, and C5.3, in the current multi-scale simulation framework.

\paragraph{C.5.2 Could age related changes in Ca$^{2+}$ metabolism result in the early death of Purkinje cells?} Some regions of the cerebellum of normal aging humans have been shown to undergo up to a 45\% decrease in the number of Purkinje cells with normal aging (Andersen et al., 2003). Simultaniously, it has been shown that the capacity for LTD is significantly reduced in normally aging mice (Woodruf-Pak et al., 2010). When it is assumed that LTD is a synaptic learning mechanism, the reduction in capacity for LTD has been linked to changes, for example, in the ability of aging mice to perform classical conditioning tasks (Woodruf-Pak et al., 2010). However, it can also be hypothesised that reduced LTD also leads to a failure in regulation of overall levels of parallel fiber activity at Purkinje cells that results in premature Purkinje cell death. In principle, this question could be addressed using the multi-scale model to be developed here. This work will be carried out during years 3-4 of the grant by the Bower group, with support from the Blackwell, Kubota, Jaeger, Steuber, and Santamaria groups.

\paragraph{C 5.3 Could age-related decrease in the number of cerebellar neurons lead to neural activity that has been linked to ataxic symptoms?} The Steuber group has recently used a biologically detailed model of a DCN neuron to study the effect of the irregular Purkinje cell activity that is found in ataxic tottering mice (Hoebeek et al., 2005) on the targets of the Purkinje cells in the DCN (Luthman et al., 2011). The results indicate that the accelerated spike rate in DCN neurons, which occurs in these ataxic mouse mutants (Hoebeek et al., 2008), can be a direct consequence of the irregular Purkinje cell firing (Luthman et al., 2011). Moreover, preliminary results show that a decrease in the number of Purkinje cells converged onto a DCN neuron accentuates this effect and increases the DCN spike rate further. As ataxic symptoms are among the behavioral changes linked to aging (ref) and a reduction in the number of Purkinje cells occurs during aging, we propose to study the potential link between cell numbers and neural activity patterns associated with ataxia with the cerebellar network model. We will incrementally prune the network model by decreasing the number of neurons and synapses to investigate the effect this has on neural activity in Purkinje cells and the DCN model. Moreover, we will use subcellular models to link the age related disruption in Ca$^{2+}$ dynamics known to occur in Purkinje cells (refs?) to the neuronal activity patterns that have been linked to motor deficits. To our knowledge this is the first attempt to apply a multi-scale model that spans from molecular dynamics to network activity, to a systems levels topic such as aging. This work will be carried out during years 3-4 of the grant by the Steuber group, with the molecular level modeling performed by the Kubota, Blackwell, and Santamaria groups.
