Target Examples for NNMDS

* Query of unit information
A user wants to combine three different models.  He loads the three
models into a nnmds user environment (this could be a directory in a
filesystem with three files, one for each model).

The XPATH expression /**/unit shows all elements that contain unit
information of the models.

* A GUI for model construction

** XML format

<parameter>
  <conductance>
    <value>5</value>
    <unit>Siemens</unit>
  </conductance>
</parameter>

GUI shows label widget with name 'conductance', followed by an edit
box with the (editable) value '5', followed with a drop down box with
from 'nano Siemens' to 'Siemens'.

** Changing values

Changing the value of the drop down, automatically scales the
conductance value.

Changing the (global) GUI preferences of what units should be used for
conductances, changes the value of the drop down.

** Preference system

*** Hints given by a model

The model can have an XML element that hints at preferences for a GUI
how to display certain parameter types.

<unit_systems>
  <reference>SI</reference>
  <GUI>
    <conductance>milliSiemens</conductance>
  </GUI>
</unit_systems>

*** GUI Preferences

The global preferences of what units a GUI should use, can have the
exact same XML format as the format in the model.  This format can
also be used for other software modules (eg. a model search and mining
engine).

** Extension by Defining new Parameters

When a user invents a new parameter with name 'new_parameter' the
scheme is updated in an intuitive way:

<parameter>
  <new_parameter>
    <value>5</value>
    <unit>Siemens</unit>
  </new_parameter>
</parameter>

<unit_systems>
  <reference>SI</reference>
  <GUI>
    <new_parameter>milliSiemens</new_parameter>
  </GUI>
</unit_systems>

The GUI displays this in the same way as for 'conductance'.

** Model validation

Model validation can only be done by running a simulation and checking
its output.  The XML syntax can be validated, but some elements can be
unknown to the simulator used.

* A user wants to compare a model with experimental data
** The experimental data consists of fMRI data
*** expresses activation levels of brain regions
** The model
*** is in SI units.
*** describes a hierarchical network
**** two populations: inhibitory + excitatory
**** feedback connected (think of one-excitatory-to-one-inhibitory connected)
*** poissonian activation of excitatory neurons
*** assume expresses oscillatory behaviour in a region of interest
*** what is the summed activity of all the
**** inhibitory neurons within a defined region of interest?
**** excitatory neurons within a defined region of interest?
**** what is the average frequency of one oscillator within the region of interest?
**** what is the average frequency of all the oscillators in the region of interest?

* Database Interfacing
** Cerebellar Cortex Network Model based on data coming from a Database
*** Experimental Volume Estimation
*** Experimental Cell Counts
*** Other Parameters
** What is the best XML representation for this?
