\section*{GENESIS Developer Installation}

\subsection*{Prerequisites}

There are several prerequisites to the construction of a GENESIS development environment. These include:

\begin{itemize}

\item {\bf Required tools:}\,{\it gdb},\,{\it gcc}, and\,{\it (x)Emacs} with the\,{\it elisp} packages. \\
{\bf Note:} The GENESIS \href{../ndf-file-format/ndf-file-format.tex}{\bf NDF\,file\,format} has a special\,{\it elisp} package for use with\,{\it (x)Emacs} that is installed as a part of the {\bf Model\,Container} package.
\item \href{../version-control/version-control.tex}{{\bf Version control:}} Monotone is used as a statically linked binary (currently version 0.45). As it is a distributed version control system, developers can use,\,{\it monotone} to maintain and exchange their code repositories and executables. Monotone installation is supported by the\,{\it Developer Package}. 
\item {\bf  The\,{\it DeveloperPackage}:} Can optionally be used to do initial directory layout. Importantly, the\,{\it DeveloperPackage} requires the correct directory layout. See the script {\it neurospaces\_create\_directories}.

\end{itemize}

{\bf Note:} Compiling from source will only produce executables and libraries for the host architecture. For example if you have a 64-bit system and 32-bit {\bf Perl}, the compiled {\bf SWIG} libraries will not load, giving an error citing "wrong architecture." So when compiling on a machine make sure that {\bf Perl}, {\bf Python} and all of their loadable modules and libraries are of the same architecture as the host machine.

\subsection*{Download Code for GENESIS Developer Installation}

Source code for GENESIS can be found at: \href{http://repo-genesis3.cbi.utsa.edu/src/}{\bf GENESIS package archive}.

The easiest way to get the latest version of the GENESIS source code is via the  \href{../developer-package/developer-package.tex}{\it DeveloperPackage}.

\subsection*{Software Dependencies}

Prior to installing GENESIS modules on your local computer you will need to install the necessary software dependencies. A general list of software dependencies can be found in \href{../genesis-dependencies/genesis-dependencies.tex}{\bf GENESIS\,Dependencies}. More specific dependencies are given in the installation documentation of the supported operating systems. For an overview see \href{../genesis-installation/genesis-installation.tex}{\bf GENESIS\,Installation}.

\subsection*{Installing the {\it DeveloperPackage}}

Download the latest version of the {\it DeveloperPackage}, available from the \href{http://repo-genesis3.cbi.utsa.edu/src/}{\bf GENESIS package archive}.  It is called {\it developer-release-label.tar.gz}, where {\it release-label} is the current release identifier. ({\bf Note:} If downloading via your browser, do not unpack the package during the download as it will be placed into its own subdirectory).
\begin{enumerate}
   \item Change to the directory where you downloaded the file.
   \item Unpack archive: ``{\tt tar xfz developer-release-label.tar.gz}''.
   \item Change to the directory with the content of the archive: ``{\tt cd developer-release-label}''.
   \item Configure the {\it DeveloperPackage}: ``{\tt ./configure}''.
   \item Compile and install the {\it DeveloperPackage}: ``{\tt sudo make install}'' (requires administrator privileges).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{General Developer Installation Procedure}

Following manual installation of the \href{../developer-package/developer-package.tex}{\it DeveloperPackage}, the generalized scheme to download and install the available GENESIS \href{../reserved-words/reserved-words.tex}{\bf Components} is via the following commands:

\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf Create the correct directory layout:}
\begin{verbatim}
	neurospaces_create_directories
\end{verbatim}
  
\item {\bf Pull all the code from the remote repositories:}
\begin{verbatim}
	neurospaces_pull
\end{verbatim}

\item {\bf Create workspace with up to date source code:}
\begin{verbatim}
	neurospaces_update
\end{verbatim}

\item {\bf Generate make files:}
\begin{verbatim}
	neurospaces_configure
\end{verbatim}

\item {\bf Clean all workspaces:} (Used when upgrading {\it DeveloperPackage}, or following a build to remove previously built files).
\begin{verbatim}
	neurospaces_clean
\end{verbatim}

\item {\bf Compile and install all the packages:}
\begin{verbatim}
	neurospaces_install
\end{verbatim}

\item {\bf Optionally check if the installation is successful:}
\begin{verbatim}
	neurospaces_check
\end{verbatim}

\end{enumerate}

\section*{Accessing the Version Control Repository from the {\it Developer Package}}

%The version control repository is accessible from the {\it DeveloperPackage}. Important for this feature to work is to have the correct directory layout on your developer machine.

%In summary, what you want to do is this: {\it pull} the set of default packages from the servers:
%\begin{verbatim}
%   neurospaces_build --repo-pull repo-genesis3.cbi.utsa.edu --repo-co \
%      --verbose --developer --directories-create --no-configure \
%      --no-compile --no-install
%\end{verbatim}
%This command has options that inhibit the default actions of configuration, compilation and installation. If you also want to compile and install in just one run, simply omit those options:

%\begin{verbatim}
%   neurospaces_build --repo-pull repo-genesis3.cbi.utsa.edu --repo-co \
%      --verbose --developer --directories-create
%\end{verbatim}

There are developer friendly frontends to the {\it neurospaces\_build} script in the {\it DeveloperPackage}:
\begin{itemize}
\item[]{\it neurospaces\_serve} Starts serving the source code repositories such that other people can {\it pull} and {\it sync} to your machine ({\bf Note} This locks all your databases).
\item[]{\it neurospaces\_pull}\,\,\,Download the source code from a repository.
\item[]{\it neurospaces\_status}\,\,\,Check for local source code modification (no network required).
\item[]{\it neurospaces\_sync}\,\,\,Synchronize local source code modification with a repository.
\item[]{\it neurospaces\_update}\,\,\,Update local source code using the repositories locally stored on your computer (so this is a local operation). 
\end{itemize}

\section*{Global Resources}

A GENESIS 3 developer keeps developer resources in the directory

\begin{verbatim}
   $HOME/neurospaces_project/
\end{verbatim}

In this directory we find a subdirectory for each of the
\href{../genesis-components/genesis-components.tex}{\bf software\,components} currently under development.

Besides the directories associated with software components, we also
find directories for local documentation ({\bf
  \$HOME/neurospaces\_project/docs}) and for source code repositories
for the \href{../version-control/version-control.tex}{\bf version\,control\,systems} 
that require a dedicated directory for this.  {\bf
  \$HOME/neurospaces\_project/\_MTN} is such a directory.

A personal text file {\bf TODO.txt} keeps track of items that wait
local implementation, but maybe are only indirectly related to GENESIS
3 development.  This file is commonly formatted according to the
\href{http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/}{\bf Emacs}
\href{http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/OutlineMode}{\bf outline\,major\,mode}.
The Emacs outline mode can be converted to latex and HTML when needed.
