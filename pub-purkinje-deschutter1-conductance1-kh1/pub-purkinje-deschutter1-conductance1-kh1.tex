   \caption{Activation and inactivation properties of the anomalous rectifier current (Kh, ---) in the model. Seady-state activation vs. voltage are plotted at the {\em left}, the time constants of activation ($\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$,) vs. voltage in the {\em middle} (Note: Semilogarithmic scale), and a simulation of representative voltage-clamp currents at the {\em right}. Note: This current does not inactivate and that activation is determined by 2 time constants\,\cite{Spain-W-J:1987ij}.}

Inward rectification has been shown to be present in the Purkinje cell\,\cite{Crepel:1986cr, Hounsgaard:1988nx} and a channel permeable to K$^+$ and activated at hyperpolarized potentials has been identified in single-channel recordings (\cite{Gruol:1989oq}, K8). However, kinetic information on this channel for the Purkinje cell is incomplete. Accordingly, we have used the equations for the anomalous rectifier (Kh) in cortical neurons published by\,\cite{Spain-W-J:1987ij}. These equations have the same activation curve (Fig. 20) as the voltage-clamp data from a single Purkinje cell shown by\,\cite{Crepel:1986cr} (their Fig. 2).
