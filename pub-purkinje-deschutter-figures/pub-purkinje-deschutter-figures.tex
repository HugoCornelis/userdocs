For each conductance steady-state activation and inactivation vs. voltage are plotted at the {\em left}, the time constants of activation ($\tau_m$) and inactivation ($\tau_h$) vs. voltage in the {\em middle} (note the semilogarithmic scale), and a simulation of representative voltage-clamp currents at the {\em right}. $A$ : Fast Na$^+$ current (---) and persistent Na$^+$ current (- - -, no inactivation). The voltage-clamp simulation shows fast sodium (NaF) current only. $B$: T-type Ca$^{2+}$ current. {\it C}: P-type Ca$^{2+}$ current. {\it D}: Anomalous rectifier. Note that this current does not inactivate and that activation is determined by 2 time constants ($\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$\,\cite{Spain-W-J:1987ij}). {\it E}: Delayed rectifier (---) and persistent K+ current (- - - , no inactivation). The voltage-clamp simulation shows Kdr only. {\it F}: A current. {\it G}: High-threshold Ca$^{2+}$-activated K$^+$ current (BK-type). {\it H}: Low-threshold Ca $^{2+}$-activated K$^+$ current (K2-type). Note that for both Ca$^{2+}$-dependent K$^+$ currents activation is controlled by the product of a voltage and a [Ca$^{2+}$]-dependent factor, each with their own time constants ($\tau_V$ and $\tau_{[Ca]}$). The voltage clamps simulate steps from a holding potential of -110 to -70\,mV up to 0\,mV in 10\,mV increments, except for {\it D}, which steps from a holding potential of 0 to -80\,mV up to -10\,mV. The voltage-clamp current amplitude has been scaled arbitrarily because we mainly wanted to demonstrate the current kinetics.}
