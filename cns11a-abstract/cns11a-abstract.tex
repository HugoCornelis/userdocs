\section*{CNS*11 Abstract 1}

\subsection*{Introduction}

An important feature of GENESIS 3 simulator (G-3) is that its use is
structured following an ideal user-workflow.  This user-workflow is
based on experimental paradigms rather than computational simulations.
As a consequence the architecture of the G-3 simulator connects it
directly to databases storing experiment data.  This presentation will
explain the G-3 database interfaces and will show examples of
data-driven modeling methods.


\subsection*{Methods}

The ideal user-workflow consists of 5 steps:

{\bf Construct model:} Simple models can be created directly within
the {\bf G-Shell} by entering commands. More complex models can be
imported into the {\bf G-Shell} from either the GENESIS model
libraries or from external model libraries. The model can also be
explored, checked, and saved.

{\bf Design experiment:} Set model parameter values specific to a
given simulation, the stimulus parameters for a given simulation run
or `experiment', and/or the variables to be stored for subsequent
analysis.

{\bf Configure simulation:} Configure runtime options, check, run,
reset simulation, and save model state. The model state can be saved
at any simulation time step to allow it to be imported into a
subsequent GENESIS session. Output is flushed to raw result storage
for subsequent data analysis.

{\bf Output:} Check simulation output and the validity of results to
determine whether simulation output exists in the correct locations.
Output can be analyzed either within GENESIS or piped to external
applications.

{\bf Iterators:} Close the loop between output of results and model
construction in the GENESIS users workflow. Iterators connect
experimental results and model output and include for example,
automated construction of simulations and batch files, static
parameter searching, and active parameter searching using the dynamic
clamp.

\subsection*{Results}

In principle each of the steps in the ideal user-workflow provides the
foundation for a single database.  Here we provide three examples.

The G-3 software component that implements the first step in the ideal
user-workflow is called the model-container.  The model-container
natively supports a dedicated data format for neuroscience models
(NDF).  The model-container has a builtin database of NDF models.  We
show how to add computational models to this database.  The
model-container interfaces with NeuroML and NineML model databases.

The second step in the ideal user-workflow connects the G-3 simulator
to databases of experimental protocols.  The database produced by this
step stores generic protocols that can be adjusted by the user for
specific experimental protocols such as current clamp and voltage
clamp.  These protocols are stored independently of the specification
of the computational model.

The separation of the steps for biological model construction and
experiment design allows the modeler to build separate libraries of
biological models and experimental protocols.  In principle this
allows any model to be combined with any appropriate experimental
protocol without the requirement that the protocol was specifically
designed for the given model.  The automation of this process would be
useful to identify the strengths, weaknesses, or deficits of a
specific model.

Finally the {\tt Iterate} step can be used to define the differences
in configuration between simulations belonging to the same simulation
project, research project, educational tutorial or scientific
publication.

\subsection*{Conclusion}

In this presentation we will show the use of computational model
databases and experimental protocol databases to drive simulations.
When combined with appropriate simulation configurations, simulations
can be run from a single command line.
