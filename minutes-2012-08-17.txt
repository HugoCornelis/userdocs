- Dave Beeman
  - recent progress:
    - namespaces documentation
      - added as ndf-namespaces to userdocs
    - createprojection well documented now
    - netview in python
- python createmap still in development
  - network component is work correctly
  - namespaces parsing has just been fixed
    - was the bug that prevented createmap from working
- questionaire
  - useful for the schedule of the workshop
- what is the schedule likely to be
  - Hugo: CBI architecture description
    - model-container
    - user workflow
    - first day, afternoon session
  - Hugo: workflow paradigm description
    - overview of workflows
    - Thursday, afternoon session
  - Jim: model publication
  - Mando: python introduction
- syntax two-cells.g3
  - alias statement
    - does not make new copies
    - creates references
      - what are consequences for setting parameters
        - three different scenarios
          - modify alias modifies all copies, when using namespace notation user expected
          - modify alias modifies all copies, when not using namespace notation, not expected by user
          - modify alias modifies a single copy, not the others, user expected
    - model-container track dependencies between prototypes
    - important for model publication
  - create connection_symbol
    - vs memory efficient connections
  - ssp_save command
    - currently only for testing
  - solverset command
    - used in two different scripts with different syntax
      - two-cells1.g3
      - rsnet-2x2-createprojection
    - difference because of a 'ce' command
  - relationship between g3 batch script and perl script
- single cell NDF files
  - cheat sheet needed
    - for manual modification done to rscell-nolib2.ndf
      - is rscell-nolib2.ndf without modification loadable using ndf_load?
      - forward parameters have been removed
- gshell inputclass_add and input_add statements
