 {\bf Querying a model in GENESIS 3.0.} The {\bf Studio} is a component of the reconfigured GENESIS software platform. It can be used to query the parameters of individual compartments in a multi-compartment model neuron. The {\bf Studio} also renders 3D morphology of dendrites and generates overviews of network models.

 {\bf Image of reconstructed Purkinje neuron dendritic segment.} Blender is an open source 3D content creation suite that can be interfaced with the GENESIS neural simulation platform to replace the functionality otherwise provided by the {\bf G-Shell} (a stand-alone GENESIS component). The rendering functions of Blender can then be used to analyze the morphology of small dendritic segments imported from electron microscopy data.

 {\bf Levels of programing in GENESIS 3.0.} The concept hierarchy used for communication by GENESIS developers. C Coding: System programing languages are used to program individual simulator components and extend simulator functionality. SLI: Indicates the level of the GENESIS-2 Script Language Interface in the concept hierarchy. Script Languages: Python and Perl are used to interface individual simulator components. NDF: The native declarative file format used to build models and model components. NDF Libraries: Model components such as membrane channels and synapses provide a library of functional components available for accelerated model development. G-Tube: The GENESIS graphical user interface allows users to access models and model components for the rapid development of single cell and network models.

 {\bf Relation of components in the Computational Biology Initiative (CBI) federated software architecture.} The CBI architecture defines the relationships between the necessary components of a computer-based neural simulation system. The architecture contains three layers that include a graphical user interface (GUI) connected to the functional components of a simulator by an interposed layer of application programming interfaces (APIs) and scripts. Components in the lowest layer are interconnected by APIs while their particular functionality is needed. GENESIS 3 is the first simulator to be implemented in compliance with the CBI architecture.
