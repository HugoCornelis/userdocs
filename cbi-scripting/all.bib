  ABSTRACT = {Computational neuroscience has produced a diversity of
  software for simulations of networks of spiking neurons, with both
  negative and positive consequences. On the one hand, each simulator
  uses its own programming or configuration language, leading to
  considerable difficulty in porting models from one simulator to
  another. This impedes communication between investigators and makes
  it harder to reproduce and build on the work of others.  On the
  other hand, simulation results can be cross-checked between
  different simulators, giving greater confidence in their
  correctness, and each simulator has different optimizations, so the
  most appropriate simulator can be chosen for a given modelling task.
  A common programming interface to multiple simulators would reduce
  or eliminate the problems of simulator diversity while retaining the
  benefits. PyNN is such an interface, making it possible to write a
  simulation script once, using the Python programming language, and
  run it without modification on any supported simulator (currently
  NEURON, NEST, PCSIM, Brian and the Heidelberg VLSI neuromorphic
  hardware). PyNN increases the productivity of neuronal network
  modelling by providing high-level abstraction, by promoting code
  sharing and reuse, and by providing a foundation for
  simulator-agnostic analysis, visualization, and data-management
  tools. PyNN increases the reliability of modelling studies by making
  it much easier to check results on multiple simulators. PyNN is
  open-source software and is available from
  http://neuralensemble.org/PyNN.},

  ABSTRACT = {Python is emerging as a common scripting language for simulators. This opens up many possibilities for interoperability in the form of analysis, interfaces, and communications between simulators. We report the integration of Python scripting with the Multi-scale Object Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE).  MOOSE is a general-purpose simulation system for compartmental neuronal models and for models of signaling pathways based on chemical kinetics. We show how the Python-scripting version of MOOSE, PyMOOSE, combines the power of a compiled simulator with the versatility and ease of use of Python. We illustrate this by using Python numerical libraries to analyze MOOSE output online, and by developing a GUI in Python/Qt for a MOOSE simulation. Finally, we build and run a composite neuronal/signaling model that uses both the NEURON and MOOSE numerical engines, and Python as a bridge between the two. Thus PyMOOSE has a high degree of interoperability with analysis routines, with graphical toolkits, and with other simulators.},
