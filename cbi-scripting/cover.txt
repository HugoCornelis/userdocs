Cover Letter to the paper titled 'Python as a Federation Tool for
GENESIS 3.0' for publication in the journal PLoS ONE.

This paper is one of two papers that reports of a new approach for
software development for the implementation of simulators in
computational neuroscience.

The two papers report our conclusions after 20 years of experience
with neurobiological simulator development and maintenance (see
abstracts).  Each paper embodies rich experience and knowledge about
new simulator development and new approaches in engineering of
software applications in computational neuroscience.  The community
aspects of these software applications have direct relationships with
the open access aspect of the PLoS journals.  The authors believe that
both papers have a great potential impact.

In the first paper titled 'A Federated Design for a Neurobiological
Simulation Engine: The CBI federated software architecture.' we
describe the philosophical and theoretical foundations of our
approach.  In the second paper titled 'Python as a Federation Tool for
GENESIS 3.0' we describe the implementation in software source code of
the GENESIS neural simulator.  The two papers complement each other
and the authors have the opinion that they are best reviewed as a
single set by the same reviewers.

Both papers clearly describe work methods, advantages and the
relationship with existing work.
