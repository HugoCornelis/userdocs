Experimental protocols supported by G-3:

- current injection
- voltage clamp
- dynamic clamp
- in vivo conditions (endogenous background)


Available simulation objects, starting at the highest scale:

- DES: spike sorting for network simulations (needs further testing).
- Heccer: single neuron solver.
- Chemesis-3: simple reaction-diffusion systems, based on Chemesis-2
- Experiment: for stimulation and recording.
