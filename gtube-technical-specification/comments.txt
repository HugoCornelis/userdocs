** gtube-technical-specification
*** simulator manager
**** seems to be equivalent to the G-3 user workflow manager
**** not present in figure 1
**** figure 2 does not have g-3 user workflow manager
***** is it possible to construct a model in one simulator and run it using a different simulator?
***** is project managment only model construction?
**** not clear why we need this
 
*** plugins
**** general comment: we first focus on G-3
**** all the rest is currently beyond scope
 
*** simulator manager page 7
**** core user requirement: where defined?
 
*** simulator plugin page 8
**** what is the current use case?
 
** experiment python glue
*** glue/swig/python/experiment/pulsegen/pulsegen.i?
*** why put pulsegen it its own python package?
**** should follow G-3 user workflow?
*** why do many methods in glue/swig/python/experiment/pulsegen/__init__.py have the same structure?
**** can this be automated?
*** naming
**** simobj_PulseGen, why simobj_ prefix?
