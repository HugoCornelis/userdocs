\section*{De Schutter: Purkinje Cell Model}

\subsection*{Introduction}
The cerebellar Purkinje cell is one of the largest and mostcomplex neurons in the mammalian nervous system. Purkinjecells have very active dendrites, generating massiveCa2+ signals in response to synaptic input\,\cite{Miyakawa:1992ly, Sugimori:1990kx}. 
Further, the unusual isoplanaranatomic organization of this cell’s dendrite hasbeen conserved to a remarkable degree through evolution
\,\cite{Ito:1984uq}, suggesting that this specific morphology is essentialto the function of the Purkinje cell.
In addition to its anatomic and physiological complexityand uniqueness, Purkinje cell activity also constitutes thesole output of the cerebellar cortex. Although the precisecomputational role of the cerebellum is not yet known, it isclear that understanding the physiology of the Purkinje cellwill be an essential part in unraveling the function of thecerebellar cortex as a whole. Given the complexity of thiscell, we believe that computer modeling techniques are necessaryto explore and analyze completely the properties ofPurkinje cells.
In this paper we describe a large, detailed compartmentalmodel\,\cite{Perkel:1981vn, rall62:_theor, W:1964oq} of the Purkinjecell based on real Purkinje cell morphology, which includes10 active voltage-dependent ionic conductances that haveso far been demonstrated to exist in these neurons. Modelparameters were established using the results of several recentvoltage-clamp studies of conductances in Purkinjecells\,\cite{Gahwiler:1989fk, Hirano:1989uq, Kaneda:1990ys, Regan:1991ly, Wang:1991bs}.We tested whether the model was robust to changes in thedensities of individual channels. The model was then usedto explore the ionic mechanisms underlying the complexresponse properties of Purkinje cells to current-clamp conditionsin vitro\,\cite{R:1980ly, R:1980pi}, which confirmedseveral postulates made by\,\cite{Llinas:1992rq}. 
In addition, modeling results focus attention on theimportance of low-threshold Ca$^{2+}$-activated K$^+$ channelsin controlling dendritic excitability. Finally, the model wasused to explore the likely accuracy of whole-cell voltageclamping experiments in this neuron.
Although several Purkinje cell models have previouslybeen described in the literature, most have not includedvoltage-dependent conductances in the dendrites
\,\cite{Llinas:1976vn, Rapp-M:1992kx, Rapp-P:1994qf, P:1985mb}. 
Models that did include ionic conductances in thedendrites either did not include all channels now known toexist\,\cite{Pellionisz:1977zr} or were applied to a verylimited set of questions\,\cite{Bush:1991ly}. In additionto exploring the mechanisms underlying this cellsresponse to current injection, the current model also laysthe groundwork for modeling and experimental studies ofPurkinje cell responses to synaptic input\,\cite{deschutter94:_purkin_ii}.
