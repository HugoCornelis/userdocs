      - The advantages of a modular architecture is extensibility and customizability.
        - By adding new components
        - By extension of existing components
      - I have software components on my laptop not available on other laptops.

        - interface to documentation system
          - 7 levels of documentation
            - source code and models can be integrated with the documentation that describes them.
            - in the future automated use cases will be used to generate figures.
              - currently converted to HTML for use by level 1 and level 2 documentation developers
          - supports many formats: latex, word, rst, etc.
          - builds a local website.
          - the documents are tagged with user chosen labels
        - regression tester
          - tests automated use cases
        - developer package
          - applies operations such as compile / install / sync / push / pull
            - on a sequence of packages
          - selectively compile a component
          - the build.yml file
            - setting options for debug / release

  - CBI architecture
    - why are we doing this, 1?
      - available software packages
      - what about interoperability between these software packages?
      - reproducability of results?
    - why are we doing this, 2?
      - genesis 2 does not support the integration of different spatial domains
    - I present a different solution here, but only G-3.
    - two different guiding structures
      - 5 step user-workflow
      - separation of concerns
    - separation between control data and biological data
    - low-level vs high-level data
    - four quadrants
    - modules
      - model-containers
      - solvers
      - scheduler / controllers
    - principled advantages
      - modules can be implemented and documented as independent components
      - the documents of the independent components identify who can do their implementation
        - chemesis-3: people with an interest in chemistry and physics
        - model-container: people with an interest in informatics
    - principled consequences for simulation
      - guaranteed to run solvers independent of the original model representation
      - solvers can be better optimized
        - hsolve of G-2 was first (heccer still needs further optimization)
        - chemesis
    - consequences for multiscale modeling
      - single model-container for all scales
      - allows to store single model as a single scientific question

    - explain biology-to-numerics translation
      - cell: no translation needed
      - set of dendritic segments: translated to numerical compartments
      - projections with connections: connections must be often be regrouped -- graph algorithms required

    - why? goals
      - introduce or 'define' common terminology
        - terms being defined within a context of a workflow
          - for instance the meaning of 'model' within the context of the user-workflow
        - between developers: smoothen development processes
        - between developers and users: communication about requirements and support
        - between mathematicians, biologists, physicists, neurologists etc.
          - to identify global concepts and targets
          - they may be encouraged to invent their own workflows or improve existing ones.
      - community related: reduce the fear for stepping in
      - sometimes overpedantic
        - user-query workflow
        - a deprecated documentation workflow
    - user-workflow
      - 5 steps
    - documentation workflow
      - includes automated regression tester

    - developer workflows
      - G-3 extension workflow
    - scientific workflow
