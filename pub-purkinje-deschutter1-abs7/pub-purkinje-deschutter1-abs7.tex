\section*{De Schutter: Purkinje Cell Model}

\subsection*{Abstract}

Finally, the model was used to study the probable accuracy
of experimental voltage-clamp data. Whole-cell patch-clamp conditions
were simulated by blocking most of the K$^+$ currents in the
model. The increased electrotonic length due to the active dendritic
membrane caused space clamp to fail, resulting in membrane
potentials in proximal and distal dendrites that differed critically
from the holding potential in the soma.
