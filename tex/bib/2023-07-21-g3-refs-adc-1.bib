Areas covered included software components for preprocessing/model setup, as well as for storage, analysis, and visualization of results. Participants discussed the need for coordinated action in the field with regard to model, method and tool development. The reports a description of the state-of-art in the field as well as recommendations for actions to facilitate infrastructure developments.},

That [a] model is not true is certainly correct, no models are---not even the Newtonian laws. When you construct a model you leave out all the details which you, with all the knowledge at your disposal, consider innesential \ldots. \textbf{Models should not be true but it is important that they are applicable}, and whether they are applicable for any given purpose must of course be investigated. This also means that a model is never accepted finally, [it is] only on trial.},

	abstract = {Complex ideas are best conveyed through well-designed illustrations.  Up to now, computational neuroscientists have mostly relied on box-and-arrow diagrams of even complex neuronal networks, often using ad hoc notations with conflicting use of symbols from paper to paper. This significantly impedes the communication of ideas in neuronal network modeling. We present here Connectivity Pattern Tables (CPTs) as a clutter-free visualization of connectivity in large neuronal networks containing two-dimensional populations of neurons. CPTs can be generated automatically from the same script code used to create the actual network in the NEST simulator. Through aggregation, CPTs can be viewed at different levels, providing either full detail or summary information. We also provide the open source ConnPlotter tool as a means to create connectivity pattern tables.},

	abstract = {As neuronal simulations approach larger scales with increasing levels of detail, the neurosimulator software represents only a part of a chain of tools ranging from setup, simulation, interaction with virtual environments, analysis and visualization. Previously published approaches to abstracting simulator engines have not received wide-spread acceptance, which in part may be to the fact that they tried to address the challenge of solving the model specification problem. Here, we present an approach that uses a neurosimulator, in this case NEURON, to describe and instantiate the network model in its native model language but then replaces the main integration loop with its own. Existing parallel network models are easily adopted to run in the presented framework. The presented approach is thus an extension to NEURON but uses a component-based architecture to allow for replaceable spike exchange components and pluggable components for monitoring, analysis, or control that can run in this framework alongside with the simulation.},

@article{davison08:_pynn,
	abstract = {Computational neuroscience has produced a diversity of
  software for simulations of networks of spiking neurons, with both
  negative and positive consequences. On the one hand, each simulator
  uses its own programming or configuration language, leading to
  considerable difficulty in porting models from one simulator to
  another. This impedes communication between investigators and makes
  it harder to reproduce and build on the work of others.  On the
  other hand, simulation results can be cross-checked between
  different simulators, giving greater confidence in their
  correctness, and each simulator has different optimizations, so the
  most appropriate simulator can be chosen for a given modelling task.
  A common programming interface to multiple simulators would reduce
  or eliminate the problems of simulator diversity while retaining the
  benefits. PyNN is such an interface, making it possible to write a
  simulation script once, using the Python programming language, and
  run it without modification on any supported simulator (currently
  NEURON, NEST, PCSIM, Brian and the Heidelberg VLSI neuromorphic
  hardware). PyNN increases the productivity of neuronal network
  modelling by providing high-level abstraction, by promoting code
  sharing and reuse, and by providing a foundation for
  simulator-agnostic analysis, visualization, and data-management
  tools. PyNN increases the reliability of modelling studies by making
  it much easier to check results on multiple simulators. PyNN is
  open-source software and is available from
  http://neuralensemble.org/PyNN.},

@article{ray08:_pymoos,
	abstract = {Python is emerging as a common scripting language for simulators. This opens up many possibilities for interoperability in the form of analysis, interfaces, and communications between simulators. We report the integration of Python scripting with the Multi-scale Object Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE).  MOOSE is a general-purpose simulation system for compartmental neuronal models and for models of signaling pathways based on chemical kinetics. We show how the Python-scripting version of MOOSE, PyMOOSE, combines the power of a compiled simulator with the versatility and ease of use of Python. We illustrate this by using Python numerical libraries to analyze MOOSE output online, and by developing a GUI in Python/Qt for a MOOSE simulation. Finally, we build and run a composite neuronal/signaling model that uses both the NEURON and MOOSE numerical engines, and Python as a bridge between the two. Thus PyMOOSE has a high degree of interoperability with analysis routines, with graphical toolkits, and with other simulators.},
